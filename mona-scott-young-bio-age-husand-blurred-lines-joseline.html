A review on the book by Victoria Christopher Murray- NAACP Awarding Winning and Essence Best-Selling Author, says;</p><p>“Blurred Lines is an epic journey through four generations of secrets that became lies and lies that blur the lines and lives of three women. This novel will keep you turning the pages until the shocking, jaw-dropping end.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=mona-scott-young-cardi-b></span><span>Mona Scott Young Cardi B</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In September 2018, Mona weighed in on Cardi B and Nicki Minaj’s brawl. In an interview with Variety, Mona described the altercation as “disheartening.”</p><p>“I think when you look at the success that both Cardi and Nicki have achieved, they are what a lot of these artists [on the show] aspire to be,” she said while comparing the situation to that of a scene on the popular VH1 franchise. “When you get to that point, there’s a different kind of struggle that comes with having reached that level of success.”</p><p>“And it’s…” she said before pausing and laughing. “What is the right word that is not gonna bite me in the a*s, here? It’s disheartening that we can’t have all of these bada*s, super-dynamic females coexisting.”</p><p>When Mona was asked if the altercation between the rappers would have ended differently had they been a part of the L&HH franchise, she said, “Well, they’d both have to be on our cast, and this would have been organic,” she said. “If they had all of the history they said they have, and all of the feelings that led to that moment, then it might have played out differently.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=mona-scott-young-and-joseline></span><span>Mona Scott Young And Joseline</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In 2018 when Mona appeared on the Wendy show, she was asked what she thinks about former LHHATL star turned WE tv star, Joseline Hernandez. Mona took a politically correct approach and praised Joseline for “going forth and prospering.”</p><p>Apparently, that pissed off Joseline and ranted against Mona for speaking on her while adding that LHHATL dropped 50% in ratings without her. Joseline twitted, “Bitch did you go to Wendy to promote my show or yours???? God bless you Mona bitch. Your show dropped 50% and if anyone call me with negativity I’m going to curse you out. I give 2 fucks about this dirty crusty mouth hoe. Check me”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=mona-scott-young-net-worth></span><span>Mona Scott-Young Net Worth</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mona has a net worth of $30 million.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=mona-scott-young-on-wendy-williams></span><span>Mona Scott Young On Wendy Williams</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=mona-scott-young-twitter></span><span><br>Mona Scott Young Twitter</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tweets by MonaScottYoung</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=mona-scott-young-instagram></span><span>Mona Scott-Young Instagram</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKWfo65uv8Koq61lqaTCr7OMm6CoZZGcsm601KyYp5xdl7m2vtGem2akmaOytHnJqKqepJmjsnA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
