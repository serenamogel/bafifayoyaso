I felt so passionate about Austin. Ultimately, his audition was shown to Tom and all the filmmakers. They agreed he had something and they were happy to know him, but they thought he was too young. At that point, I saw that this actor has something very special that other people don’t always have. It’s almost the way he looks into the camera. He knows the camera and lets the camera see him, and that is really what is so captivating.”</p><p data-characters=220 data-current-count=220 data-injectable=false>It definitely wound up being a blessing for audiences, as Butler’s performance as the King of Rock received nearly universal acclaim, masterfully wielding the swagger and turmoil of Elvis in a manner most electric.</p><p data-characters=67 data-current-count=287 data-injectable=false>Elvis and Top Gun: Maverick are both currently playing in theaters.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomK6rpJ67bq7UraOeql2Wua670q1kqaSRrrKledGopqyslad6qrqMraapZZequ265wK%2Bcq6GToHqjscWoqZ5lkpqutbXNoGSmoZyawG7AxKWjnqpdqbxuscuvoKxn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
