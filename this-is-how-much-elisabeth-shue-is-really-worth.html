Along with the fact that she's managed to steadily and consistently score roles of various sizes in the past, there is also no sign of her slowing down any time soon. That's why there is a very good chance that she will continue to add to her current fortune, which is already undeniably impressive. According to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>, as of this writing, Elisabeth is worth $12.5 million.</p><p dir=ltr>That happens to be quite a bit more than her Karate Kid co-star Ralph Macchio who's worth&nbsp;<a href=#>$4 million</a>, but is half of what her onscreen partner from The Saint, Val Kilmer, is banking with his <a href=#>$25 million</a>. Her Leaving Las Vegas castmate Nicolas Cage also has twice as much as Elisabeth with <a href=#>$25 million</a> (although he did once have around $100 million before his lavish spending seriously depleted his budget).</p><p>When it comes to family, Elizabeth's fortune can't really compare to what her brother has taken in. That's because Andrew Shue's journey "<a href=#>from Melrose Place to ... internet mogul</a>" helped him build up a net worth that sits at a whopping $100 million. Maybe it's time for Elisabeth to branch out from show business and get into the online media business like her super-rich sibling.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma3FmaIB2e9OhoKxlmah6qbvWZqSum5hisq210pqZnqyYYsCpwcRmoKxlopqurbjYZq6oqqSdfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
