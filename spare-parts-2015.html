In fact, what should have been the main event – the actual competition that serves as the finale – arrives almost as an afterthought. Even Lopez’s character turns out to have a heart-wrenching reason for his current situation, but it just gets lost in the shuffle.</p><p>Each of the young actors has a distinctive appeal that isn’t entirely capitalized upon and their rapport with Lopez and each other is what should be front and center. Making the biggest impression is Carlos PenaVega as Oscar, a driven-to-succeed senior whose undocumented status stands in the way of him pursuing his dream of enlisting in the Army. Instead, he turns to Lopez and asks to start a robotics club so he can enter the contest, which involves building an underwater vehicle.</p><p>He ends up recruiting three other members: Cristian (David del Rio of “<a href=#>Pitch Perfect</a>”), a bullied computer geek who is the brains of the operation; Lorenzo (<a href=#>Jose Julian</a>, <a href=#>Demian Bichir</a>’s son in “<a href=#>A Better Life</a>”), a shaggy-haired mechanical whiz who isn’t above breaking into vehicles now and then; and Luis (newcomer Oscar Guitirrez), a gentle giant who provides the muscles to carry the vehicle in and out of the water.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46sp5qqlWK9or7TrGRraGFq</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
