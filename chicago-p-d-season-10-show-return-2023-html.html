Season 10. The series returns with new episodes on Wednesday, Jan. 4, 2023, during NBC’s usual time slot of 10 p.m. ET.</p><p id=par-3_54>So, what can fans anticipate in episode 10, titled “This Job”? “A series of brutal home invasion robberies finds the team paired with Det. Borkowski, an old friend of Ruzek’s, to work the case,” the plot synopsis reads. “Things get complicated for Torres when it becomes clear Borkowski has a vastly different policing style.”</p><p id=par-4_70>Episode 10 will likely focus on Adam Ruzek and newcomer Dante Torres. Torres continues to prove he’s an asset to the Intelligence Unit, but he’ll be put to the test with Borkowski in charge. As for Ruzek, <a href=#>he and Kim Burgess</a> still have to figure out what comes next in their relationship. Burgess and Ruzek’s push-and-pull relationship will likely bring them even closer together toward the end of season 10.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The rest of the season will take on a ‘savior’ theme</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-5_58>Chicago P.D. Season 10 showrunner Gwen Sigan spoke to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadline</a> about what fans can anticipate seeing throughout the season. The <a href=#>beginning of season 10 proved seriously dark</a>, especially for Hailey Upton and Hank Voight. Upton dealt with the fallout of Jay Halstead leaving, and Voight dealt with the death of Anna Avalos. But there’s lightness on the horizon.</p><p id=par-6_42>“The season is not going to be all dark,” Sigan promised. “The theme we’re going for this year is savior and we’re looking at this question: Can the broken be saved? So we will see some saving happening this season as well.”</p><p id=par-7_55>As for as Upton is concerned, Sigan says she’s in a “tough place,” which she’ll have to deal with the rest of the season. “She’s someone that’s not necessarily the best at dealing with her emotions,” Sigan continued. “She likes to be in control and likes to feel like she has control of her headspace.”</p><p id=par-8_43>Burgess might also need saving. She’ll continue to face her past traumas with Ruzek by her side. “And I think they’ll always have that relationship that’s so complicated and messy, but they’re going to continue to have each other’s back,” Sigan told Deadline.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Will Jay Halstead return in ‘Chicago P.D.’ Season 10?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Jay-Halstead-Hailey-Upton-Chicago-P.D.-Season-10.jpg><p id=par-9_22>Fans weren’t ready to say goodbye to <a href=#>Jay Halstead in Chicago P.D.
