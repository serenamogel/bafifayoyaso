This American pop-punk band got its debut in 2004 after Fall Out Boy bassist Pete Wentz originally signed them. Not long after, their first studio album was released, entitled “A Fever You Can’t Sweat Out.” Since then, the group has had almost immediate success among fans of the genre, as well as plenty of teenagers getting to know the punk scene, previously popularized by groups like Blink-182, Green Day, and of course, Fall Out Boy.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=641 data-current-count=641 data-injectable=true>Nowadays, several fans of the genre have remained fans of Panic! At The Disco since their primordial starts in the early 2000s. Just recently, though, the one-man band, led by Brandon Urie, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">have announced their split from the music world</a>. In an emotive letter to fans, Urie said goodbye to Panic! At The Disco via a UK and Europe tour one last time before officially being “no more.” In spite of spending well over a decade in the music industry, with plenty of pebbles along the way, many fans still have wondered about the origin behind their name. Where exactly did the catchy and memorable name Panic! At The Disco come from?</p><h2 id=h-panic-at-the-disco-is-not-an-ode-to-a-smith-s-song data-injectable=false>Panic! At The Disco is not an ode to a Smith’s song</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=607 data-current-count=907 data-injectable=true>The band today known as Panic! At The Disco originally consisted of members Ryan Ross, Spencer Smith, and Brent Wilson. Friends from childhood, the trio originally created the band with the intention of being called “Pet Salamander.” The idea was then discarded in favor of the name “Summerleague Rock,” which also did not take off with the trio of friends. The latest addition to the group was Urie, and upon his integration as the vocalist, guitarist, and bassist, the band took on the name Panic! At The Disco, derived from an underground emo band called “Name Taken.”</p><p data-characters=551 data-current-count=551 data-injectable=true>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">AmericanSongwriter</a>, Urie has disproven the rumor surrounding the band’s name. Apparently, Urie took inspiration from the Orange, California band’s 2004 track “Panic,” which featured the lyrics “Panic at the disco/Sat back and rook it so slow.” Previously, it was believed the name was an homage to The Smith’s song “Panic,” which featured the chorus “Burn down the disco,” thus making it believable that the group would adopt the wording into their own band’s name.</p><p data-characters=517 data-current-count=517 data-injectable=true>As of 2023, the group now consists of Urie alone, with two touring members Nicole Row and Mike Naran, who join the singer during tours and concerts. The former members of the group included Ryan Ross (guitarist, vocalist, and songwriter 2004-2009), Jon Walker (bassist, 2006-2009), Brent Wilson (bassist, 2004-2006), Ian Crawford (touring guitarist, 2009-2012), Dallon Weekes (bassist, 2009-2017), Kenneth Harris (touring guitarist, 2013-2018), and Spencer Smith (drummer 2004-2015), who have all since left the band.</p><p data-characters=94 data-current-count=94 data-injectable=false>Panic!
