We previously covered some of the subjects that they will cover next season on Dark Side of the Ring. The 4th season could be the show’s best, because thatMarty Jannetty episode is supposed to be “insane."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

We also see a few extra faces like Mick Foley, Jim Ross, and Tony Atlas in the new video. It wasn’t specifically stated who anyone was refereeing to in the clips during that trailer, but the mood was certainly set.</p><p>Themes of drugs, sex, and racism will be featured in the next season of Dark Side of the Ring. We can only imagine that Junkyard Dog’s episode will be hard to watch for a lot of people, but that probably goes for a lot of the episodes next season. Shawn Micahels, who had an affair with Tammy Lynn Sytch for some time, might also be afraid of what will come out during Tammy and Chris Candido’s episode.</p><p><a href=#>The Marty Jannetty episode of Dark Side of the Ring</a> will be insane. Only time will tell if fans consider that the most outlandish episode when the season airs.
