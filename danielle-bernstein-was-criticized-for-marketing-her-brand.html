The influencer recently announced the debut of her new bikini line on Instagram, adding that revenues from the sale would benefit people affected by the crisis. However, online users were not sold by the notion, believing that the model was using the tragedy to promote her business. The influencer had blogged about introducing her swimsuit with a statement that expressed her thoughts on the present scenario. The caption highlighted that one might serve the planet while indulging in self-indulgence. The following was part of the post:</p><p>“I realize that sharing a picture of yourself in a bikini isn’t going to assist anybody, but you know what will? The earnings from this swim will benefit an on-the-ground organization in Ukraine.”</p><p>The post was criticized for its word choice, prompting Bernstein to rewrite the caption. The new caption clarified that the charity was not new to her business. She said that every WeWoreWhat launch gave a portion of its profits to various charities. The captions also disclosed that the firm has previously donated $250k to Ukrainian refugees and another $5k to Global Empowerment. The influencer also offered a third payment after the postponed swimsuit launch. She published a post excerpt and donation link on Instagram, raising an extra $15,000.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Danielle-Bernstein-2.jpg alt="Danielle Bernstein" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Danielle Bernstein was included in Forbes’ list of the 30 under 30.</h2><p>Danielle Bernstein was born on May 22, 1992, in Great Neck, New York.
