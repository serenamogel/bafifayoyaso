The Dallas Mavericks player had a brilliant rookie season, setting multiple records within his team and NBA history as well as being selected for the NBA All Stars at such a young age. Doncic has shown that he‚Äôs incredibly talented; he‚Äôs definitely brushing shoulders with some of the best players in the game right now. But basketball isn‚Äôt his only skill as he has revealed that he enjoys playing video games such as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Overwatch</a> as well.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=399 data-current-count=399 data-injectable=false>Although the NBA star usually keeps his likes and interests out of the conversation in interviews, it turns out that he‚Äôs always down for a game of Overwatch every now and again. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">He made an unplanned appearance on Twitch user M0xxy‚Äôs stream</a> whilst playing <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Overwatch 2</a> yesterday. When asked by the streamer whether he has any hobbies he gave a very humble reply, ‚Äúyeah I play basketball.‚Äù</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=699 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Clipped this additional bit.</p><p>Luka gets interrogated to make sure it's actually him.</p><p>How does he respond?</p><p>"I'm him" üòé üòÇ <a href=#>#MFFL</a> <a href=#>https://t.co/FDDT00i97f</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/zljP5gLVlT</a></p>‚Äî ‚ô¶Ô∏èZafri‚ô¶Ô∏è (@ZafriZee) <a href=#>March 7, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=269 data-current-count=269 data-injectable=false>When pressed further, he revealed the level to which he plays basketball and who he actually was to the surprise of M0xxy and viewers in the chat. M0xxy then verified his identity by asking him a few questions to see if he was the real deal. Which it turns out, he was.</p><p data-characters=525 data-current-count=794 data-injectable=true>Back in 2018, the NBA star also revealed that he was a big fan of the first Overwatch as well, so it seems like he‚Äôs been a long-time player of the games. He used to spend around two to three hours a day playing games, which is no surprise for someone as young as Doncic who likely grew up with them. Whilst he‚Äôs still young, it‚Äôs likely that he doesn‚Äôt have as much time to dedicate to games such as Overwatch anymore, due to his basketball career taking off, but he obviously still sets aside a bit of time to play.</p><p data-characters=440 data-current-count=440 data-injectable=true>Even the biggest of sports stars still enjoy the simple pleasure of video games, just like the rest of us. As it turns out, he has revealed a few games that he does enjoy, including the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty</a> franchise and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">FIFA</a>. He‚Äôs also appeared on the cover of NBA 2K22, although he hasn‚Äôt said whether or not he‚Äôs played the game itself. As for Overwatch, if you‚Äôre wondering, he‚Äôs revealed that he mains Hanzo, Roadhog and Cassidy.</p><p data-characters=205 data-current-count=205 data-injectable=false>So now we know the truth, Doncic is a gamer at heart and basketball is just his hobby. So don‚Äôt be surprised next time you‚Äôre playing a game online, if you find yourself fighting alongside an NBA star.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmejpbyzwNJom6ido2K7o62MrKuaql2hwqytjJ2mp5uZmHqxuMCyZKiulafEosDCoWY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
