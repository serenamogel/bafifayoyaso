She has&nbsp;otherworldly powers, but they're undeveloped and largely unacknowledged by her. We glimpse them in the movie's early narrated sequences (which suggest a nonexistent <a href=#>Terrence Malick</a> horror film) and in moments when she seems to communicate telepathically with a handsome but unnervingly intense classmate named Sorensen Carlisle (<a href=#>Nicholas Galitzine</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>The story kicks into gear when Carmody&nbsp;Braque (Timothy&nbsp;Spall),&nbsp;a soft-spoken loner who lives in the local rail yard, befriends Jacko, inviting him into the trailer&nbsp;where he&nbsp;stores his prize collection of dolls and stuffed animals. Carmody is an affable fellow, and Spall plays him in a way that keeps both Laura and the audience off-balance: at first it's hard to tell if he's truly dangerous or if it's our paranoid&nbsp;imagination assuming the worst.&nbsp;A key theme established early by&nbsp;co-directors <a href=#>Miranda Harcourt</a> and <a href=#>Stuart McKenzie</a> is the importance of young people, girls especially, learning to trust that inner voice that tells you that you're in danger, even when the person triggering&nbsp;that alarm—and perhaps the society that enfolds all of us—is insisting that everything is okay. Even the heroine's mother gaslights her, though of course&nbsp;without meaning to; Lynskey plays her&nbsp;as a woman who only wants what's best for her children, based on her own understanding of reality.&nbsp;</p><p>Carmody is, in fact, a very bad man. He declares himself Jacko's special friend and caretaker, lures him back to his hideout, and marks him&nbsp;with an ink stamp that lets&nbsp;him enter the boy's&nbsp;soul and control him like a puppet.</p><p>Did you get a chill just now? I did, and I've already seen the movie.&nbsp;</p><p>From there,&nbsp;"The Changeover" becomes a kind of supernatural detective story, with Laura feeling guilty over disregarding that voice and letting Carmody...well, "violate" is a strong word, but what happens between him and Jacko absolutely feels&nbsp;like a violation—an unholy breach of trust between adult and child. It's&nbsp;not physical or sexual abuse by any traditional definition if the phrase, but feels somehow equally vile.&nbsp;Carmody makes it clear that he's been doing this kind of thing for&nbsp;a long time (an early Freudian slip refers to an event that happened a thousand years ago) and will continue doing it because no one is strong enough to stop him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tn55lk52ur7PEqK2eql1nfXKF</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
