Did I try them all? Hell no. I want to do a good job here, but I also want to live. I went about this taste test by curating a list of the most popular and most enduring Lean Cuisine meals, from sesame chicken to Swedish meatballs, microwaved them according to the package instructions, and then judged them based on how good they taste. I’m confident these are the best Lean Cuisine meals you can buy.</p><p class=has-small-font-size>The following article contains affiliate links that may generate a small commission to us when you make a purchase through the link.

If you’re a comfort food guy like me, a genuine fan ‘o cafeteria cuisine, I can’t imagine a better “healthy” lunch. The gravy could use more mushrooms, but the flavor is rich and beefy, and the steak itself is tasty and less gristly than the Lean Cuisine meatloaf. This came in fourth in our <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">frozen salisbury steak ranking</a>, mostly because it reads as healthy compared to more decadent salisbury steaks, like Stouffer’s and Hungry-Man. But in the realm of diet dinners, if you want something rib sticking, filling, and nostalgic, this is definitely the best Lean Cuisine meal you can buy.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best lean cuisine roasted turkey" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/BEST_LEAN_CUISINE_INSET_02.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Sad Holiday Dinner</p><strong>Roasted Turkey Breast</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Instacart</a><p>A frozen meal that mimics Thanksgiving dinner might sound even more depressing than your typical sad little desk lunch, but I’m telling you, this is tasty enough to make you feel festive. The turkey medallions have a surprisingly pleasant taste and texture (much better than any of the chicken we tried), the gravy is savory, and the stuffing is clumpy and herby in that delicious Stove Top kind of way. My favorite part of this meal, though, are the cinnamon apples. Seriously, even with 15-plus frozen dinners to taste, I polished off every bite of those sweet, syrupy, spiced apples. A majorly nostalgic and extremely delicious dessert right there in the the tray. Brilliant.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best lean cuisine santa fe style rice and beans" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/BEST_LEAN_CUISINE_INSET_03.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Rice Dish</p><strong>Santa Fe-Style Rice & Beans</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Instacart</a><p>I wasn’t in love with this Lean Cuisine, but my colleagues <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Danny Palumbo</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jordan Myrick</a> helped me reconsider its virtues. Apart from the smoky taste of cumin, this corn-dotted take on rice and beans kind of lacks flavor and isn’t nearly as cheesy as it looks on the box, but with just a little bit of extra attention, this dish would really come to life. Jordan suggested either topping it with diced avocado for added richness, or dousing it with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">hot sauce</a> and then piling the whole shebang into a low-carb tortilla and making a burrito. Make it your own and you’ll be in good shape.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best lean cuisine shrimp scampi" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/BEST_LEAN_CUISINE_INSET_04.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Seafood</p><strong>Shrimp Scampi</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Instacart</a><p>Shrimp is my favorite food, but I can’t tell you how dubious I was that microwaved shrimp would be anything but rubbery and gross. This Lean Cuisine was an extremely pleasant surprise. The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">angel hair pasta</a> is tender but toothsome, and doused in a bright, citrusy garlic sauce that tastes like cooking wine in a way I kind of loved (although in my Italian-American opinion, the noodles in this dish are spaghetti not angel hair). And the shrimp is sizable, tender, and has enough seafood flavor to remind you that you’re eating something that came from the ocean (or at least a shrimp farm). My favorite part of this taste test was discovering that microwavable seafood actually works.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best lean cuisine lasagna with meat sauce" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/BEST_LEAN_CUISINE_INSET_05.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Italian</p><strong>Lasagna with Meat Sauce</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Instacart</a><p>Lean Cuisine has a handful of Italian-inspired, red sauce-drenched dishes, but this Lasagna with Meat Sauce is especially cheesy and delicious. The meat in the lasagna doesn’t contribute a ton of flavor, but it does add some good texture. The sauce is tangy and feels nice and oily, and there’s a good amount of cheese on the dish too. We also liked Lean Cuisine’s Cheese Ravioli, but the portion seemed way too small. This one is more substantial, which helped it edge out its competition. What makes this one of the best Lean Cuisine meals you can buy is that it doesn’t feel like diet food at all.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="lean cuisine steak portabella" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/BEST_LEAN_CUISINE_INSET_06.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Beef</p><strong>Steak Portabella</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Instacart</a><p>Okay, so, I know a “steak” took the top spot on this list, but let’s be clear: There’s a big difference between what you expect from a chop steak and what you expect from actual slices of steak steak. I was certain the Steak Portabella—slices of steak in a brown mushroom gravy with broccoli—would be inedibly chewy and gross. I’m pleased to report I was wrong. The steak is pretty damn tender and actually has a nice beefy flavor; I really liked the texture of the mushrooms with the steak, but they should consider adding about two times as many of them to the tray. I mean, it’s in the name of the dish—mushroom representation, please!</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>7.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best lean cuisine french bread pizza" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/BEST_LEAN_CUISINE_INSET_07.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Junk Food</p><strong>French Bread Pepperoni Pizza</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Instacart</a><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">I’m on the record</a> as a big fan of a Stouffer’s French bread pizza (which I firmly believe should be cooked in the oven rather than the microwave). This little microwavable pizza can’t quite hold a candle to the genuine article, but it’ll definitely scratch that French bread pizza itch in a pinch. The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">pepperoni</a> is the highlight. The cheese is a little sparse and doesn’t melt all that well—low-fat cheese typically doesn’t—and the bread gets just a little chewy in the microwave, but the pepperoni slices are salty, oily, and spicy. This feels like a really fun splurge for having only 300 calories.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>7.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="lean cuisine macaroni & cheese" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/BEST_LEAN_CUISINE_INSET_08.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Comfort Food</p><strong>Macaroni & Cheese</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Instacart</a><p>You know what makes frozen mac and cheese taste super good? A lot of cheese and lots and lots of butter. I learned this from Patti LaBelle, songstress and purveyor of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">an extremely delicious frozen mac and cheese</a> that just so happens to have 32 grams of fat per serving (sometimes you just really shouldn’t read the back of the box). Suffice it to say, Lean Cuisine mac and cheese isn’t going to live up to its fattier and more calorie-laden counterparts, but it’s salty, creamy, and feels like junk food in a fun way. There isn’t a lot of variety in this meal, but if you want something super simple or something you can dress up yourself with, say, a handful of canned peas and some sliced-up veggie hot dogs, this is the best Lean Cuisine meal you can buy.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>7.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><p><strong>Other products we tried:</strong> Sesame Chicken, Meatloaf with Mashed Potatoes, Swedish Meatballs with Pasta, Cheese Ravioli, Macaroni and Beef, Alfredo Pasta with Chicken and Broccoli</p><p class="has-light-purple-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><strong>Find the best Lean Cuisine at home and share with us using #SporkedTasteTest for a chance to be featured on our social pages!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJqVqMFuuMSapWabpZ7AqrrEZqSemZyofA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
