After completing her degree, she joined her family’s business, Ann Summers, which at the time was a struggling retail chain that sold clothing and lingerie. Gold quickly realized that the company’s sales were suffering due to the negative perception of sex toys and adult entertainment in society, which led her to make a significant change to the company’s product offerings.</p><p>In 1981, Gold introduced a new range of lingerie and sex toys, which proved to be a huge success. She became the company’s managing director in 1987 and, under her leadership, Ann Summers grew into a thriving business with over 140 stores and a multi-million-pound turnover.</p><p>Gold is known for her innovative approach to marketing and branding. She was the first to introduce the concept of a “party plan” for sex toys, where women could host private parties in their homes and sell Ann Summers products to their friends. This concept proved to be highly successful and helped to remove the stigma around sex toys and adult entertainment.</p><p>In 1993, Gold became the first woman to appear on the cover of Management Today, a prestigious business magazine in the UK. She has received numerous awards and recognitions for her work in the business world, including an Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 2016 for her services to entrepreneurship, women in business, and social enterprise.</p><p>Aside from her work at Ann Summers, <a href=# rel=noopener>Gold </a>is also a committed philanthropist and supporter of women’s rights. She is the founder of the Gold Group International, a charitable organization that provides financial support and mentoring to young women who want to start their own businesses. She is also a patron of the Rainbow Trust Children’s Charity, which provides support to families who have children with life-threatening illnesses.</p><p>In recent years, Gold has become an outspoken advocate for mental health awareness and has spoken openly about her own struggles with anxiety and depression. She has also been a vocal supporter of the #MeToo movement, speaking out about her own experiences of sexual harassment in the workplace.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jacqueline Gold Children: Meet Her Only Daughter</h2><p>Jacqueline Gold was a known mother, and at the time of her death, she had a daughter. The name of her child is Scarlett. Aside from her name, little is actually known about her.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqOYnKmlmrmqusRmnqiklGKwqbXLnamepl2isqbAjKGcq2Wfo7m6ecOarKCgpJq%2FcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
