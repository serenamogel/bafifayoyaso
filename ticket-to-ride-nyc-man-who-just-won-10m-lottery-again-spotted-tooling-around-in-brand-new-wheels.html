Wayne Murray, 63, was spotted leaving his $800,000 East Flatbush home in the luxury top-of-the-line wheels after scoring $10 million on a scratch-off ticket this week — and having previously won $10 million playing the New York Lottery just a little over a year ago."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He keeps it real, keeps it honest.”</p><p>Murray lives in an unassuming three-story, semi-attached brick home where he’s lived most of his life, according to his neighbors.</p><p>And he’s so down to earth that Constance Bryane — whose home is attached to Murray’s — didn’t even know about his incredibly good fortunes.</p><p>“I had no idea. He’s very humble that way,” she told The Post on Thursday. “I’m going to have to congratulate him the next time I see him.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGtmaXBforK1vs5oq6Kbm5rBbsDOZqminJViu7qvjKaYp2WnnbxuttSsq2avn6N6cnzMZqOorKSav7p5wKCYoqZdqL2wwNOem2asn6S5qrrGZpirp6WjsW61zWaZq5memXqvsdZmrqGdlaHAcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
