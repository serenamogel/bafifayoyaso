The cream-filled cake is a go-to gas station treat that is often (wrongly) believed to last forever. What else did we get wrong about the Twinkie? What is a Twinkie, really? Let’s find out. Let’s talk Twinkies!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>What is in a Twinkie? What are Twinkies made of?</h3><p>A Twinkie is a cream-filled golden sponge cake made from enriched wheat flour, sugar, water, and eggs. The cake is leavened with baking soda and baking powder, giving it a light and fluffy texture. The filling consists of a creamy vanilla-flavored mixture, made with ingredients like vegetable shortening, sugar, and artificial flavors. The packaging consists of plastic wrap. Don’t eat it.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Are Twinkies vegan?</h3><p>Twinkies are not vegan, as they contain several animal-derived ingredients, including eggs and dairy. Eggs are a key ingredient in the sponge cake, providing structure and texture, while dairy is present in the form of whey and other derivatives in the creamy filling. While there have been occasional limited-edition releases of vegan or plant-based versions of Twinkies, the traditional recipe is not suitable for those following a vegan diet.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>When were Twinkies invented?</h3><p>Twinkies were invented in 1930 by James Alexander Dewar, who worked for the Continental Baking Company, later known as Hostess Brands. It all started with a surplus of shortcake pans, which were used to make strawberry shortcakes. To maximize the use of these pans and reduce waste during the strawberry off-season, Dewar developed “golden sponge cake filled with a creamy vanilla-flavored filling.” The original filling recipe was based on a banana cream filling, but due to a wartime banana shortage in the 1940s (plus a fear of the factory being attacked by hungry chimpanzees), it was replaced with the familiar vanilla.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Do Twinkies expire?</h3><p>While Twinkies have a relatively long shelf life compared to many perishable items, and have been the subject of <a href=# rel=noopener>urban legends that they could survive a nuclear blast</a>, they actually do have an expiration date. The shelf life of Twinkies is typically several weeks to a few months, depending on various factors such as storage conditions. Twinkies are known for their longevity, but it’s advisable to consume them within the recommended timeframe for the best eating experience. Sorry, preppers! You’ll have to stick to <a href=#>canned goods</a>, we’re afraid!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaK%2BYlsFutdJmmGasp567rLXEaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
