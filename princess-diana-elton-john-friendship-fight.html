Before he knew it, John found himself dancing with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/royalty/princess-anne data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Princess Anne" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Princess Anne</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/royalty/queen-elizabeth-ii data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Queen Elizabeth II" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Queen Elizabeth II</a>, as she clutched onto her handbag, and they all grooved to Bill Haley’s “Rock Around the Clock.” “I tried my best to come up with a facial expression that suggested this was a perfectly normal state of affairs,” <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.powells.com/book/me-elton-john-official-autobiography-9781250231055 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="John wrote" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">John wrote</a> in his 2019 autobiography Me.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But all that changed with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/royalty/princess-diana data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Princess Diana" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Princess Diana</a> showed up. “She was blessed with an incredible social ease, an ability to make people feel totally comfortable in her company,” he wrote. “That night in 1981, she arrived in the ballroom and we immediately clicked. We ended up pretending to dance the Charleston while hooting at the disco’s feebleness.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">From that moment, a bond was formed, one that would lead them through both heights of their careers, as well as tragedies in their friend circles. “Over the years I knew her, she was fabulous company, the best dinner party guest, incredibly indiscreet, a real gossip: you could ask her anything and she'd tell you,” John wrote.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">John witnessed Diana’s effect over men like Richard Gere and Sylvester Stallone</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The famous friends were often spotted at major events, like chatting backstage at the 1985 Live Aid concert and John performing for Diana at a 1997 concert for the Prince's Trust.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But it was behind closed doors that they truly began to understand one another. John recalled a dinner party he hosted with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actor/richard-gere data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Richard Gere" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Richard Gere</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actor/sylvester-stallone data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sylvester Stallone" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Sylvester Stallone</a> as guests — along with a very single Princess Diana.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“The most peculiar scene developed. Straight away, Richard Gere and Diana seemed very taken with each other,” <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7539485/Elton-John-Night-flirty-friend-Diana-Stallone-Gere-fighting-her.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="John wrote" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">John wrote</a>. “They ended up sitting in front of the fireplace together, locked in rapt conversation.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But he soon realized things weren’t quite right: “As the rest of us chatted, I couldn't help notice a strange atmosphere in the room. Judging by the kind of looks he kept shooting them, Diana and Richard Gere's newly blossoming friendship was not going down well with Sylvester Stallone at all.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">John says there was a thwarted fistfight between the two movie stars and ultimately Stallone left in a huff. Throughout it all, Diana held her composure. “She seemed completely unruffled,” he wrote. “Maybe she hadn't realized what was happening. Or maybe stuff like that happened all the time and she was used to it.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">That was when John came to realize the power the princess held. “If I was bowled over by Diana, it was nothing compared with the impact she could have on straight men. They seemed completely to lose their minds in her presence: they were just utterly bewitched.”</p><img alt="Princess Diana chatting with Elton John and George Michael at the Feed the World Live Aid concert in July 1985" title="Princess Diana chatting with Elton John and George Michael at the Feed the World Live Aid concert in July 1985" width=2008 height=2684 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-78967344.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Photo: Popperfoto via Getty Images/Getty Images</span><p>Princess Diana chatting with Elton John and George Michael at the Live Aid concert in July 1985</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">John hit a 'deep freeze' with the princess</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Whatever that intangible effect was that she had on men, John also realized that her true power came through in her <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/news/princess-diana-africa-humanitarian-work-landmines data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="selfless show of humanity" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">selfless show of humanity</a>. “That famous photo of her holding an AIDS patient's hand at the London Middlesex Hospital — that was Diana,” he wrote in his book. “I don't think she was necessarily trying to make a big point, although obviously she did: in that moment, she changed public attitudes to AIDS forever.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Even so, their deep friendship hit a trouble spot — which Tina Brown called a “deep freeze” in <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2007/07/diana200707 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Vanity Fair" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Vanity Fair</a> — over a 1997 coffee table book, Rock and Royalty, created with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/fashion-designer/gianni-versace data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Gianni Versace" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Gianni Versace</a> to benefit the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://ejaf.org/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Elton John AIDS Foundation" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Elton John AIDS Foundation</a>. The book had photos of the royal family, including one of Diana and her sons <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/royalty/prince-william data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Prince William" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Prince William</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/royalty/prince-harry data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Prince Harry" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Prince Harry</a>, among photos of semi-nude male models. She had also agreed to write the book’s forward. But suddenly, she pulled out — very last minute.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“Diana feared that would upset the Queen,” Brown wrote, but that wasn’t the story John was told. “She said she had no idea of the book's contents, which just wasn't true: Gianni had shown her the whole thing and she had said she loved it,” he wrote.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Confused, he reached out to try to straighten things out. “I wrote back to her, calling her out, telling her how much money she had cost the AIDS Foundation, reminding her that she had seen the book.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In response, he received a “formal and severe” letter than began, “Dear Mr. John.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The cold response infuriated John, who considered the princess a dear friend. But his emotions ran deeper. He was concerned about her. “She seemed to be losing touch with all sorts of really close friends, who would be honest with her, and surrounding herself instead with people who told her what she wanted to hear,” he wrote. “I knew from personal experience that wasn't a healthy situation.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But the rift was there. “It’s one of those things that friends sometimes do,” <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/elton-john-life-career-pictures/diana-princess-wales-comforts-pop-star-elton-john-weeps-openly/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="John told CNN" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">John told CNN</a> of their falling out. “You know, they’re too proud to pick up the phone.”</p><h2 data-node-id=25 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">The sudden death of Versace reunited the friends</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Sadly, it took a tragedy — the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/news/the-assassination-of-gianni-versace-murder-andrew-cunanan data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="brutal murder of mutual friend Versace" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">brutal murder of mutual friend Versace</a> in July 1997 — for the two to find their way back to one another. As soon as the news spread, John found Diana on the other end of the line. “I don't even know how she got hold of the number; we hadn't had the house in Nice for long,” John wrote in his autobiography. “She was just down the coast, in Saint-Tropez, on <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/business-figure/dodi-fayed data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Dodi Fayed's" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Dodi Fayed's</a> yacht. She asked how I was, if I'd spoken to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/fashion-designer/donatella-versace data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Donatella class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Donatella</a>. Then she said: ‘I'm so sorry. It was a silly falling out. Let's be friends.’”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Friends again, Diana sat next to John at Versace's funeral. During the services, a photographer took a now-famous photo of what appeared to be Diana leaning towards John to console him. But John eventually revealed the truth about the moment: “They snapped her just as she was leaning past me, reaching for a mint that <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/news/elton-john-david-furnish-love-story data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="David [Furnish]" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">David [Furnish]</a> offered her. The warm words of comfort coming from her lips at that exact moment were actually: ‘God, I'd love a Polo.’”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Even in their time of grief, they had found some levity — the cornerstone of their friendship.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">That reconciliation sparked more letter writing. John wrote her a thank you note, and she responded offering to be a patron of his foundation and asked him to be one for a landmine charity she was working with.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“We were going to meet up next time we were both in London to have lunch and discuss it,” he wrote. “But there wasn’t a next time.”</p><h2 data-node-id=31 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">John called performing at Diana's funeral 'the biggest gig of my life'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On August 31, 1997, John was awoken by the sound of the fax machine with a handwritten message from a London friend saying, “So sorry to hear about this awful news.” Perplexed, he turned on the news and learned that his beloved friend <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/news/princess-diana-death-legacy data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Princess Diana had died in a tragic car crash" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Princess Diana had died in a tragic car crash</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">He never expected, just six weeks later, to be sitting at another funeral. This time, he sang “Candle in the Wind” to his friend, with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://time.com/5701169/elton-john-princess-diana-royal-family/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="lyrics changed by his writing partner Bernie Taupin" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">lyrics changed by his writing partner Bernie Taupin</a> to honor Diana with the words, “You called out to our country, and you whispered to those in pain.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Mourning his friend, the performance was one of the most difficult of his life. “There was a sense in which it was the biggest gig of my life — for four minutes, I was literally going to be the centre of the world’s attention — but equally, it wasn’t an Elton John moment, it wasn’t about me at all,” he wrote.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Ultimately that day, he saw Princess Diana’s legacy in the faces of her young sons. “William and Harry looked completely shell-shocked,” he remembered. “They were 15 and 12, and I thought the way they were treated that day was absolutely inhuman. They were forced to walk through the streets of London behind their mother’s coffin, told to show no emotion and look straight ahead. It was a horrendous way to treat two kids who’d just lost their mum.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">And to this day, John feels that pull to Diana through William and Harry, as <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://twitter.com/eltonofficial/status/1163479333689860099 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="he tweeted " class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">he tweeted </a>in August 2019 after an invasion of Harry’s privacy. “Prince Harry’s Mother, Diana Princess Of Wales was one of my dearest friends. I feel a profound sense of obligation to protect Harry and his family from the unnecessary press intrusion that contributed to Diana’s untimely death.”</p><img alt="Princess Diana trying on a kimono that she received as a gift at Nijo Castle, Kyoto, during an official visit to Japan on May 1986" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/1_-princess-diana-1961---1997-trying-on-a-kimono-that-she-received-as-a-gift-at-nijo-castle-kyoto-during-an-official-visit-to-japan-on-may-1986-photo-by-georges-de-keerlegetty-images.jpg title="Princess Diana trying on a kimono that she received as a gift at Nijo Castle, Kyoto, during an official visit to Japan on May 1986" width=3477 height=5127 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Open Gallery<span class="css-1w4f7je es31yw60"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.biography.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt title="Black right arrow" width=100% height=auto decoding=async role=img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGipqLGRocG6e8%2BroKeblajAbrDImqWaZZWhwbC6jKOmoaZdm7%2Bqsc2dqqGhoGKzqrPHrQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
