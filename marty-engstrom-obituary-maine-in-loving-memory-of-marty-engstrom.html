He did this with great care. Engstrom, who had a background in broadcast engineering, began making weather forecasts for the Portland station WMTW in 1964, despite the fact that he was not inclined to do so.</p><p>He accomplished this feat while standing on the platform of the transmission tower of the station, which was situated on Mount Washington in the state of New Hampshire. In addition to reading his findings from hand-written cue cards that he taped to the camera and wearing a clip-on bow tie, Engstrom also read his findings with a Maine accent that was so thick that some viewers thought it must be a fake.</p><p>His unpolished and folky approach made him a favorite among viewers, and he became known to generations of Mainers simply as “Marty on the Mountain.” His popularity stemmed from his unpolished way. His music has a tone that is reminiscent of country musicians.</p><p>The Maine Association of Broadcasters bestowed upon Engstrom the most prestigious honor of being inducted into their Hall of Fame in the year 2019. The year 2002 marked the official beginning of Engstrom’s retirement from WMTW. It was stated by his daughter, Anita Williams, that he passed away on Thursday at the age of 86 at his residence in Fryeburg. His death occurred on Thursday.</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpwucCrq7JllaO0tMDRqKRmp5Kewbat0bJkppmZo7Jutc1mo6iumaO0brnEpqarsV2ks265wKursmWVo7S0wNGopGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
