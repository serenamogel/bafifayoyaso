As one of the members of One Direction, Styles shot to stardom with Ed Sheeran-penned pop hits, but tends toward emulating his rock idols like David Bowie and Mick Jagger in his solo endeavors. That rock star influence goes beyond his music; like his idols before him, Styles’ personal life is a source of speculation for fans and the media alike.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=601 data-current-count=601 data-injectable=true>To be fair, he’s given us a lot to speculate — last year’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Don’t Worry Darling</a> promo tour was wrought with drama from “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spitgate</a>” to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">salad recipes</a> and rumored on-set romance. The center of the film’s drama seemed to revolve around the relationship between Styles and the film’s director Olivia Wilde. Rumors ran rampant as the film’s release date drew nearer, and in the midst of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the entire internet trying to decide if Styles really did spit on Chris Pin</a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">e</a> (seriously, we were obsessed), a subsection of speculators were wondering whether Wilde and Styles would ever make it official.</p><p data-characters=472 data-current-count=472 data-injectable=true>Then, almost as quickly as everything started, it all came to an end. Don’t Worry Darling was released to average reviews, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chris Pine dashed the internet’s dreams</a> by denying Styles spit on him, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Styles and Wilde fizzled out in Nov. 2022</a> after about two years together. In the aftermath of the relationship, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Styles has been linked with other people</a>, but recent beach photos of the “Watermelon Sugar” star have brought last year’s romance back to our attention.</p><h2 id=h-does-harry-styles-new-tattoo-say-olivia data-injectable=false>Does Harry Styles’ new tattoo say ‘Olivia’?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Harry Styles flashes new tattoo seemingly dedicated to ex Olivia Wilde <a href=#>https://t.co/1LdxDKYLIU</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/M5J6BGo3oE</a></p>— Page Six (@PageSix) <a href=#>July 30, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=550 data-current-count=850 data-injectable=true>On July 28, Styles was photographed vacationing on a boat in Italy with James Corden and his wife Julia Carey, Victoria’s Secret model Jacquelyn Jablonski, and her reported partner, businessman Xander Ritz. Like most people vacationing in a hot location, Styles had a decent amount of skin on display, giving the photographers a good look at his many tattoos. The singer has some beautiful ink, but one particular tattoo caught everyone’s attention: a tattoo on his right thigh that appears to read “Olivia” in cursive script.</p><p data-characters=752 data-current-count=752 data-injectable=false>As you’d expect, people immediately connected the tattoo to Styles’ relationship with Wilde. It definitely seems that the “As It Was” singer commemorated his relationship with a tattoo of his lover’s name, but some fans believe there’s a different reason Styles got this specific tattoo; while most believe the ink is a tribute to Wilde, there’s some speculation that it’s referencing the 2015 One Direction song “Olivia” instead. Whatever the meaning may be, I’m more curious about the meaning of the “colazione” tattoo (“breakfast” in Italian) underneath the aforementioned “Olivia,” and whether the two are connected. Harry, what does it all mean?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2SxsLHSZp%2BaqqKuerTA2KWcrGWYlsOmecBmq5qspKS8brLOq2SopJmrtqJ51qKjnZ1f</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
