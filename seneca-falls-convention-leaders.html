Its purpose was "to discuss the social, civil, and religious condition and rights of women.” Organized by women for women, many consider the Seneca Falls Convention to be the event that triggered and solidified the women's rights movement in America. Historians and other scholars agree that the leaders of the Seneca Falls Convention played a significant role in shaping the first wave of feminism in the United States and starting the fight for women’s suffrage.</p><h2 data-node-id=2 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Stanton and Mott led the convention</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The leaders of the Seneca Falls Convention were <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/activists/elizabeth-cady-stanton data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Elizabeth Cady Stanton" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Elizabeth Cady Stanton</a> and her friend <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/activists/lucretia-mott data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Lucretia Mott" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Lucretia Mott</a>. These two abolitionists met nearly ten years earlier at London’s World Anti-Slavery Convention in 1840. Although they were outspoken activists against slavery and other social injustices, their voices remained unheard of in a world where men’s voices dominated. Together, the duo vowed to work toward a society where women’s voices would resound loudly and their rights would be equal to men’s.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Stanton and Mott were a likely pair from the start. Both northerners (Stanton from New York and Mott from Massachusetts), they were outspoken activists from early ages. In her 20s, Mott became a progressive Quaker minister well-known for her speeches against social injustice. At the age of 17, Stanton graduated from Emma Willard's Troy Female Seminary and began her fight for abolition, temperance, and women's rights. With Stanton’s eloquent writing skills and Mott’s powerful speaking abilities, the two were destined to be heard.</p><img alt="Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton" title="Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton" width=800 height=500 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/lucretia_mott_elizabeth_cady_stanton_public_domain_visa_wikimedia_commons.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Photo: Public Domain via Wikimedia Commons</span><p>Lucretia Mott (left) and Elizabeth Cady Stanton (right)</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Declaration of Sentiments and Grievances was modeled after the Declaration of Indpendence</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Drafted by Stanton and introduced at the Seneca Falls Convention, the Declaration of Sentiments and Grievances was a treatise modeled closely on the Declaration of Independence. Stanton added “women” to its preamble proclaiming “We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men and women are created equal…” She went on to describe the injustices, inequities, and invisibilities that American women felt and ended the Declaration with a call for action. Stanton wanted U.S. women to organize and fight for equality. On the second day of the convention, the Declaration of Sentiments and Grievances was ratified by the assembly which included <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/activists/frederick-douglass data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Frederick Douglass" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Frederick Douglass</a>. They also passed 12 resolutions that specifically necessitated equal rights for women including the ninth resolution that proclaimed women’s right to vote. This effectively marked the beginning of the women’s suffrage movement in America.</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">The 19th Amendment was passed more than 70 years after the convention</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Following the Seneca Falls Convention, many national woman’s rights conventions were held annually throughout the United States with many focusing on women’s suffrage. Serving as its first President, Stanton founded the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA) in 1869 along with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/activists/susan-b-anthony data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Susan B. Anthony" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Susan B. Anthony</a>. More than 70 years after the women’s suffrage movement began in Seneca Falls, Congress passed the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/activists/19th-amendment-famous-suffragists data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="19th Amendment" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">19th Amendment</a>, which granted women the right to vote in 1920. This landmark victory changed American women’s lives forever and later ushered in new waves of feminism focused on a wide range of issues including reproductive rights, sexuality, family, the workplace, immigration and gender equality.</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">The legacy of the women of Seneca Falls continues</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1948, a U.S. postage stamp commemorating the Seneca Falls Convention titled “100 Years of Progress of Women” was issued. It featured Stanton,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/activists/carrie-chapman-catt data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=" Carrie Chapman Catt" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"> Carrie Chapman Catt</a> and Mott.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1980, a seven-acre park was established in Seneca Falls and named <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nps.gov/wori/index.htm data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="“The Women's Rights National Historical Park.”" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">“The Women's Rights National Historical Park.”</a> It includes the location of the Seneca Falls Convention (Wesleyan Methodist Church), Stanton's home which she referred to as “the Center of the Rebellion,” and the M'Clintock House where Mary Ann M'Clintock hosted a planning session on July 16, 1848, for the Convention and where the Declaration of Sentiments and Grievances was written.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1998, First Lady Hillary Clinton gave a speech to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Seneca Falls Convention. She <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.thelizlibrary.org/undelete/library/library017.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=reflected class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">reflected</a> about these events with passion and candor:</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“I often wonder, when reflecting back on the Seneca Falls Convention, who of us - men and women - would have left our homes, our families, our work to make that journey one hundred and fifty years ago. Think about the incredible courage it must have taken to join that procession. Ordinary men and women, mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, husbands and wives, friends and neighbors. And just like those who have embarked on other journeys throughout American history, seeking freedom or escaping religious or political persecution, speaking out against slavery, working for labor rights. These men and women were motivated by dreams of better lives and more just societies…. Help us imagine a future that keeps faith with the sentiments expressed here in 1848.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2016, the U.S. Treasury announced new changes. Keeping in theme with the changes to the $20 bill which include <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/activists/harriet-tubman data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Harriet Tubman" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Harriet Tubman</a> prominently featured on its front, on the back of the newly redesigned $10 bill sit five powerful women who contributed to the women's suffrage movement including Stanton, Mott, Anthony, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/activists/alice-paul data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Alice Paul" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Alice Paul</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/activists/sojourner-truth data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sojourner Truth" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Sojourner Truth</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Although these women have been celebrated in numerous ways throughout history, this is the first time Stanton and Mott will be featured on U.S. cash. Their roles in the 1848 Seneca Falls Convention secured them a place in women’s rights history and it is notable that they will be commemorated in this way. As pioneers in the drive for women’s suffrage and anti-slavery activism, their voices at the Seneca Falls Convention continue to resound loudly.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGiYnKyZq7a0wNJoqp6mlZiubrLApaOsZZOku7exza2gqKZdobKisMSrqg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
