The chorus, which begins the song, says, "Why you always in a mood... actin' brand new. I ain't tryna tell you what to do, but try to play it cool," per <a href=#>Genius</a>. Simply put, the rappers are hinting that their love interests need an attitude fix.</p><p dir=ltr>The first verse begins with Dior confessing he isn't one to commit and that he's not going to serve this girl's every need. "I could never get attached. When I start to feel, I unattach," he sings, adding, "I am not your dad... I just want your company." Dior is just there for a good time with this girl, but she's not letting that happen. 24kGoldn takes the second verse and immediately questions the relationship. "So why you tryin' to fake your love on the regular?" he asks. While the song is based off of some rocky relationships, the point of it is to lighten up.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>24kGoldn definitely has a positive attitude about his hit, especially because it was an "accident," according to his interview with Seattle's <a href=#>107.7 The End&nbsp;radio station</a>. Apparently, the California native was playing video games with Dior and guitarist Omer Fedi when Fedi started playing a guitar riff. "I just start singing without even really realizing it...&nbsp;and 'Mood' comes out," he recalled.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbG1lbn52e9OhnGaqlZa5brnEmqWippdir6a0yKebZqWfpLFurthmaW2jl6S5pbqMpbCroZOoeqbEz6WYoqaVmXw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
