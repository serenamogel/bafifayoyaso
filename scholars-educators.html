Economics of the time were dominated by the idea that a country’s wealth was best measured by its store of gold and silver. Smith proposed that a nation’s wealth should be judged not by this metric but by the total of its production and commerce—today known as the gross domestic product (GDP). He also explored theories of the division of labor, an idea dating back to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/scholars-educators/plato data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Plato class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Plato</a>, through which specialization would lead to a qualitative increase in productivity.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Main Beliefs and "Invisible Hand"</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Smith’s ideas are a reflection on economics in light of the beginning of the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/topics/industrial-revolution/industrial-revolution data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Industrial Revolution" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Industrial Revolution</a>, and he states that free-market economies (i.e., capitalist ones) are the most productive and beneficial to their societies. He goes on to argue for an economic system based on individual self-interest led by an “invisible hand,” which would achieve the greatest good for all.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In time, The Wealth of Nations won Smith a far-reaching reputation, and the work, considered a foundational work of classical economics, is one of the most influential books ever written.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Professional Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1748, Smith began giving a series of public lectures at the University of Edinburgh. Through these lectures, in 1750 he met and became lifelong friends with Scottish philosopher and economist David Hume. This relationship led to Smith's appointment to the Glasgow University faculty in 1751.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">More Books by Adam Smith</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1759, Smith published The Theory of Moral Sentiments, a book whose main contention is that human morality depends on sympathy between the individual and other members of society. On the heels of the book, he became the tutor of the future Duke of Buccleuch (1763–1766) and traveled with him to France, where Smith met with other eminent thinkers of his day, such as <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/benjamin-franklin data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Benjamin Franklin" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Benjamin Franklin</a> and French economist Turgot.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Smith's other writings include Lectures on Justice, Police, Revenue, and Arms (1763), which was first published in 1896, and Essays on Philosophical Subjects (1795). Both works were published posthumously.</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Death</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1787, Smith was named rector of the University of Glasgow, and he died just three years later, at the age of 67.</p><ul data-node-id=21 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: Adam Smith</li><li>Birth Year: 1723</li><li>Birth date: June 5, 1723</li><li>Birth City: Kirkcaldy</li><li>Birth Country: Scotland</li><li>Gender: Male</li><li>Best Known For: Scottish social philosopher and political economist Adam Smith wrote 'The Wealth of Nations' and achieved the first comprehensive system of political economy.</li><li>Industries</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Politics and Government</li><li>Business and Industry</li><li>Education and Academia</li></ul><li>Astrological Sign: Gemini</li><li>Schools</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>University of Oxford</li><li>University of Glasgow</li><li>Burgh School</li></ul><li>Death Year: 1790</li><li>Death date: July 17, 1790</li><li>Death City: Edinburgh</li><li>Death Country: United Kingdom</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="body-tip css-i9osfz e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.
