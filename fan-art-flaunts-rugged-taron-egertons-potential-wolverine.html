And the latest Wolverine artwork to pop up features the Kingsman star fully embracing the rugged Hugh Jackman look.</p><p data-characters=237 data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true>Digital artist Britedit has created an excellent design for the next potential MCU Wolverine. This well-crafted piece has Egerton rocking the signature goatee, hairstyle and adamantium claws as well as the yellow costume from the comics.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/85239647_172536994052384_5877297875286182670_n.jpg><p data-characters=316 data-current-count=316 data-injectable=false>Obviously, this would be an excellent look for Logan’s debut in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It’s very reminiscent of Jackman’s style with a fresh new costume while still staying true to the source material. The result is a satisfying mix of both old and new that fans of all ages can get behind.</p><p data-characters=570 data-current-count=886 data-injectable=true>Of course, there’s no question that Egerton has what it takes to play a superhero, but filling Jackman’s shoes is a huge responsibility. The rumors of him portraying the character have also been <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">downplayed by the actor</a> and despite the fan approval, he doesn’t believe<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> he’s the right choice for the part</a>. Other big names like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daniel Radcliffe</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom Hardy</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Scott Eastwood</a>&nbsp;and even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stranger Things star Dacre Montgomery</a> have all been photoshopped into Wolverine as of late, so there are certainly several options out there to choose from for Marvel.</p><p data-characters=121 data-current-count=121 data-injectable=false>Tell us, though, who would be your first choice for the MCU’s <strong>Wolverine</strong>?
