In 2018, Kansas City Chiefs traded away starting quarterback Alex Smith and Mahomes was promoted into the starting role.</p><p>He has since made Kansas City Chiefs one of the best and most consistent teams in the NFL having appeared in three of the past four Super Bowls and won two of them.</p><p>Having won last year’s Super Bowl over the Philadelphia Eagles, <a href=# rel=noopener>NFL odds</a> have Kansas City Chiefs as a favourite to repeat this success in the new season.</p><p>The Chiefs Super Bowl win, and Mahomes first, in 2019 was the team’s first trip to the Super Bowl in in 50 years. Mahomes won the Super Bowl MVP award and was shortly after rewarded a 10-year extension to his contract worth $477 million with around $26 million more in potential bonuses.</p><h2><span id=Luxury_Lifestyle><strong>Luxury Lifestyle</strong></span></h2><p>With a $500 million contract extension, Mahomes isn’t having to count the pennies when he goes out to shop.</p><p>The quarterback recently caught the attention at the 2023 Met Gala with his Cartier Santos watch. Mahomes, at this lavish event, is usually a big fan of Rolex watches, so it was a surprise to see him wearing something else at such a big event.</p><p>Eyes will be on Mahomes every time he attends an event now to see what he will be wearing.</p><p>He has such an interest in top quality watches that his current collection is said to have cost him over $850,000 which includes two Rolex Yacht Masters and Daytonas along with a $36,000 Omega Seamaster Aqua Terra.</p><p>He doesn’t just spend on expensive jewellery for himself. In 2020 after his Super Bowl win, Mahomes proposed to his ling-time girlfriend with a ring rumoured to cost somewhere between $400,000 and $800,000.</p><p>As well as watches, Mahomes has an extensive shoe collection of around 180 pairs. The shoe closet has its own security system. He has been asked many times about his shoe collection, something he has always wanted to have space for and waited for the right space to put them. His favourites are apparently a pair of Adidas Yeezy boost 750’s which have high-cut zippered ankles and is one of the first from Adidas to feature almost no visual branding.</p><p>Mahomes is also a fan of sports cars and his most costly being his Ferrari 812 Superfast super car. The starting price for this model is from $338,000 while Mahomes has his lavishly equipped. He also ensured his partner isn’t missing out and bought her a Lamborghini Urus with a twin-turbo v8 engine that goes from 0-60 miles per hour in just over three seconds.</p><p>All of these extravagant belongings are located in one of his luxury homes.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Mahomes bought his first condo</a> back in 2017 after being drafted in Kansas City for around $350,000. His first major house purchase came in 2019 when he shelled out $1.8 million on a three-bedroom mansion in Kansas City which he has recently put up for sale for $2.9 million.</p><p>This mansion is up for sale after Mahomes had bought a vacant land plot in Belton, Missouri in 2020 and built a new home on the grounds with an outdoor pool which was completed in 2022.</p><p>His main home is in his native Texas. A $3.37 million Westlake, Texas mansion with four bedrooms and seven bathrooms. Spanning over 7,800 square feet it is his family’s home and where he spends the majority of his time in the off-season.</p><p>&lt;iframe width=”560″ height=”315″ src=”https://www.youtube.com/embed/iB0mLFLN108″ title=”YouTube video player” frameborder=”0″ allow=”accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share” allowfullscreen>&lt;/iframe></p><p>(Patrick & Brittany Mahomes | House Tour | $2 Million Kansas City Mansion & More)</p><h2><span id=Investments><strong>Investments</strong></span></h2><p>While he may have plenty in the bank, Mahomes is investing his money to ensure his long-term financial future for his family for generations.</p><p>He bought a stake in the Kansas City Royals in 2020 which made him the youngest team owner in MLB baseball history. He is also part of the ownership group for Sporting Kansas City (SKC) who play in MLS.</p><p>Mahomes said of why he invested in the Royals and SKC; “I love this city and the people of this great town. This opportunity allows me to deepen my roots in this community, which is something I’m excited to do.”</p><h2><span id=Charity_Work><strong>Charity Work</strong></span></h2><p>Along with these local sports ownerships, he has invested in ‘Hyperice’, a producer of performance recover products; ‘Whoop’, a digital fitness performance company; ‘Buzzer’, a live sports mobile platform; and ‘Whataburger’ a fast-food chain which was originally in Texas, but Mahomes has brought Franchises to Kansas and Missouri.</p><p>Along with the luxury lifestyle and investments to manage his financial growth, Mahomes also funded new voting machines at Arrowhead Stadium to ensure residents could vote and has started his own charity called <a href=# rel=noopener>“15 and the Mahomies”.</a> Launching in 2019, the charity is dedicated to improving the lives of children and he has donated over $500,000 of his own money into the charity.</p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gossipsinside.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/shubham-optimized.jpeg width=100 height=100 alt="Shubham Kansal" itemprop=image loading=eager fetchpriority=high style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><a href=# class="vcard author" rel=author><span class=fn>Shubham Kansal</span></a><p>Shubham Kansal is a bit addicted to the latest happening in the political and sports world.
