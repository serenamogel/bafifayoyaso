There has been quite a time jump since Naruto Next Generation finished, moving the characters four years into the future. Boruto has remained on the run, but that doesn‚Äôt seem to have stopped him from upgrading his powers and his wardrobe. Images dropped for the October issue of V-Jump which gave fans a look at the new design of Boruto on its cover, and fans are loving it.</p><p data-characters=403 data-current-count=403 data-injectable=true>The image came via a leak on X (Twitter), and shows Boruto giving off some serious ‚Äúdrip‚Äù vibes as he is fully accessorized up with belts, bracelets, and necklaces, along with a new cloak reminiscent of Sasuke‚Äôs design. It isn‚Äôt just the clothes that give off the vibe, but the very pose of the character is markedly different from the ball of energy we were first introduced to.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>2 belts with a chain, a wrist band, single fingerless glove, eye scar, slashed headband, 2 chain necklaces, rolled up shirt, jacket and cape.
