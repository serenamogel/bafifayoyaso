If you knew Chuck, you know why this really hurts. If you didn’t know him, I hope someday you have someone in your life with his sense of humor & zest for living. My last conversation with him in April was filled with Chuck’s laughter from the start of the call to the end. Chuck had a long stint in sports, showing off his versatility as a copy editor, designer, columnist and reporter before moving to S.A. Life, where he thrived writing mainly about BBQ. Throughout it all, he was just so much damn fun to be around and the kind of colleague who made you better. My deepest condolences to his wife Debbie Erwin and daughter Isabelle.</p><p>Chuck’s loss is felt deeply by his family, friends, and colleagues. He was taken too soon, but his legacy will continue to live on through his writing, his passion for barbecue, and the memories he created with those who knew him. His death is a reminder to take nothing for granted, to cherish the time we have with our loved ones, and to stay true to the things that bring us joy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZminqJyusb%2BNqKmgZ5OdwqS3jJujqK2eqXw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
