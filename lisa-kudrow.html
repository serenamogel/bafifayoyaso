She enjoyed early success on the TV comedy Mad About You, before achieving fame as Phoebe Buffay on the wildly popular sitcom Friends. Kudrow went on to appear in such films as Romy and Michele's High School Reunion, The Opposite of Sex and Analyze This. She has also starred on the improvisational web-turned-TV series Web Therapy and the HBO comedy show The Comeback.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Kudrow was born on July 30, 1963, in Encino, California. Her father, Lee, was a physician with a specialty in studying headaches, and her mother, Nedra, was a travel agent. The youngest of three children, she grew up in a middle-class Jewish family. As a teenager, Kudrow excelled at tennis and played on the varsity team at Taft High School in Los Angeles.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After earning a degree in biology from Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York, Kudrow returned to Los Angeles to work with her father and follow a career in research. Her brother's childhood friend, comedian Jon Lovitz, encouraged Lisa to perform, and she tried to break into acting while continuing to work for her father as a medical researcher. Eventually Kudrow became a member of the renowned Los Angeles improv comedy troupe The Groundlings. She honed her comedic skills there and with other improv groups, including Unexpected Company, alongside <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/conan-obrien data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Conan O'Brien" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Conan O'Brien</a>, and the Transformers Comedy Group.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Kudrow's early foray into television comedies was marked by ups and downs. She unsuccessfully auditioned for Saturday Night Live in 1990, but did land the role of Ursula, the spacey waitress on the sitcom Mad About You in 1992. She then appeared on a few episodes of the Bob Newhart show Bob in 1993. However, after being cast that same year for the role of Roz in Frasier, she was replaced during the filming of the pilot episode by Peri Gilpin.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Career Highlights</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Kudrow's biggest break came when she was cast as Phoebe Buffay, the lovable folk-singing massage therapist, on the sitcom Friends. The show became an instant hit after premiering in 1994, and Kudrow went on to earn an Emmy Award in 1998 and a Screen Actors Guild Award in 2000 for her work on the prime-time comedy. She also reprised her role as Ursula from Mad About You, who appeared on Friends as Phoebe's twin sister.
