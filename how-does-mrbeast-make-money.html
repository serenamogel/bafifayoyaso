There may be more methods outside of his brand, but these are the main ways the YouTuber gets things done.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>How Does Mr Beast Make Money?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><h3 data-injectable=false>Ad revenue</h3><p data-characters=223 data-current-count=523 data-injectable=true>MrBeast published a video in December of 2018 called “How I Gave Away $1,000,000” and in its conclusion, he shared that the money had come from his YouTube revenue stating “YouTube pays better than you think.”&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=325 data-current-count=325 data-injectable=false>While it isn’t clear what CPM MrBeast has on his channel, he seems to be earning an extremely healthy amount from views on the platform. This is a common practice creators use to get by and with the millions of views each of his videos gets, it’s no wonder MrBeast is able to fund his videos with income from his channel.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Sponsorship</h3><p data-characters=235 data-current-count=560 data-injectable=true>Another great way that creators including MrBeast bolster their income is by taking on brand sponsorships. MrBeast has quite a few regular sponsors like the internet plugin Honey, but he’s also taken on one-time sponsors in the past.</p><p data-characters=154 data-current-count=154 data-injectable=false>This process works by the brand paying a fee for MrBeast to shout out their brand or product on his video for his audience to hear and hopefully purchase.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Merch</h3><p data-characters=333 data-current-count=487 data-injectable=false>One of the other ways that <strong>MrBeast</strong> makes money is through his merch line. Available at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">shopmrbeast</a>, Jimmy sells a variety of products from shirts, jumpers, even school supply sets. These products are extremely popular among his fanbase and with their size likely bring in a massive amount of passive income for the creator each year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmemnrGmu9Jon6ivXZm8pr%2BMpqmbnZGowW65wKScZqWfo7K6ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
