Griffith is the daughter of <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/tippi-hedren data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Tippi Hedren" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Tippi Hedren</a>, once a muse of director <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/alfred-hitchcock data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Alfred Hitchcock" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Alfred Hitchcock</a> and star of his 1963 hit, The Birds. At age 14, Griffith — reportedly with the permission of her mother — began dating Don Johnson, eight years her senior. The relationship lasted four years, with the couple marrying in January 1976 and divorcing six months later.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Even before her hard-partying teenage years with Johnson, Griffith reportedly remembers drinking wine as early as age 10, and <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://archive.vanityfair.com/article/1994/7/melanie-unplugged data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="told Vanity Fair" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">told Vanity Fair</a> in 1994 she was not apologetic about the years when her days would begin with vodka and end with cocaine. “I didn’t get something I needed that I needed when I was little. I was never loved unconditionally. Coke, booze, give you a feeling, a physical sensation … a buzz inside your body that takes the place of something you should have had as a child.”</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">The relatively-unknown Griffith struggled to get cast in the movie</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Before filming began, studio execs wanted a well-known name to play Tess. According to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/harrison-ford-melanie-griffith-working-girl-oral-history-1164247 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Hollywood Reporter" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/demi-moore data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Demi Moore" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Demi Moore</a> was originally signed on for the role but later left the project. Cheers star Shelley Long was also considered for the role, as was <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/michelle-pfeiffer data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Michelle Pfeiffer" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Michelle Pfeiffer</a>, but she was eventually deemed too sexy to play Tess.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">"They didn't even want to see me for the movie," Griffith told THR in 2018. "The studio wanted a bigger name. I mean, I wasn't very much of a name, but I loved this role, and I knew I could do it. My story is Tess' story."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Eventually, Griffith got a chance to read for the role and won over casting director Juliet Taylor and the film's director Nichols.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">"She was the girl. It was almost a visceral reaction," Taylor told THR of Griffith's audition. "She was adorable, funny, vulnerable, sexy — everything. And real."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">However, although Griffith had landed her dream role, her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/celebrity/inside-story-melanie-griffiths-struggle-with-addiction/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="substance abuse issues" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">substance abuse issues</a> made the filming process a difficult one.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“There were a lot of things that happened on Working Girl that I did that were not right,” <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://ew.com/movies/2019/11/12/melanie-griffith-recalls-having-to-pay-80000-after-coming-to-working-girl-set-intoxicated/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Griffith recalled" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Griffith recalled</a> in Life Isn’t Everything: Mike Nichols as remembered by 150 of his closest friends. “It was the late ‘80s. There was a lot going on party-wise in New York. There was a lot of cocaine. There was a lot of temptation.”</p><img alt="Melanie Griffith Harrison Ford Sigourney Weaver Working Girl" title="Melanie Griffith Harrison Ford Sigourney Weaver Working Girl" width=5542 height=3721 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-607405488.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Photo: Sunset Boulevard/Corbis via Getty Images</span><p>Melanie Griffith, Harrison Ford and Sigourney Weaver on the set of ’Working Girl’</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Nichols fined Griffith for showing up to set under the influence</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Others involved in the production recall Griffith being unreliable, and the crew was often worried she would not be able to perform. Towards the end of the shoot, their fears were realized when Griffith got drunk while playing pool with costar <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/alec-baldwin data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Alec Baldwin" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Alec Baldwin</a>, who was not drinking.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“Then we got back to the set, I had vodka in my motor home, so I had a slug of vodka, and it mixed and made me so drunk, which I thought was really funny,” Griffith said in Life Isn’t Everything. “But it wasn’t, and it was cold, and I had to walk down the stairs with Alec, and I couldn’t do it.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Working Girl producer Douglas Wick remembered getting a call from Nichols that “Melanie was clearly high” on set. Wick reportedly learned later that Griffith was having drugs delivered to her on the set.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“Mike got so mad at me, he wouldn’t talk to me,” Griffith recalled in the book. “Mike Haley, the first [Assistant Director], just came up and said, ‘We’re shutting down. Go home,’ and I knew I was in so much trouble. … The next morning he (Nichols) took me to breakfast and said, ‘Here’s what’s going to happen. You’re going to pay for last night out of your pocket. We’re not going to report you to the studio, but you have to pay for what it cost,’ and it was $80,000. They wanted to get my attention and they really did. It was a very humbling, embarrassing experience, but I learned a lot from it.”</p><img alt="Melanie Griffith Harrison Ford" title="Melanie Griffith Harrison Ford" width=5431 height=3748 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-607405494.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Photo: Sunset Boulevard/Corbis via Getty Images</span><p>Melanie Griffith and Harrison Ford in ’Working Girl’</p><h2 data-node-id=25 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Griffith entered rehab shortly after the movie wrapped</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Three weeks after the movie wrapped, Griffith entered a treatment facility and credits the help of ex-husband Johnson, who had been sober since 1983, in championing her own sobriety. “Don was actually waiting for me when I got out of rehab,” <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://time.com/4726332/melanie-griffith-addiction-divorce-plastic-surgery/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Griffith told Porter magazine" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Griffith told Porter magazine</a> in 2014. “We got back together; it was the most natural, perfect, loving thing.” The couple would marry for the second time in 1989, the same year their daughter, Fifty Shades of Grey star <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/dakota-johnson data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Dakota Johnson" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Dakota Johnson</a>, was born. However, the marriage ended four years later when Johnson began abusing alcohol and drugs again.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Griffith would also continue to struggle with sobriety, returning to rehab in 2000 and 2009, both while married to actor <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/antonio-banderas data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Antonio Banderas" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Antonio Banderas</a>, but always made sure she was there for her children. “I was a totally functioning mom.
