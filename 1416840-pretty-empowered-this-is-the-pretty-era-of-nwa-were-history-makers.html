You’ve been here for a sip of coffee and you’re getting a shot at my title? That’s crazy. We’ll make an example out of them. Honestly does not even compare to Pretty Empowered.”</p><p>Envy responded by describing how Pretty Empowered have made history, and they’re the champions for a reason.</p><p>“I don’t know if you remember us saying that we are history makers, not just tag team champions. Kylie is the youngest champion in NWA history, and I’m a 3x World Women’s Tag Team Champion,” Ella Envy said. “It’s for a reason, we hold these belts for a reason. Just like, there’s a reason Markova has never held a belt in this company.</p><p>“I don’t even know who Taylor Rising is. I just remember her trying to cut in front of us at catering one time and we had to put her in her place. Like I said, Kylie and I are not just two thrown-together girls. So, you best bet that we will walk out with our tag team championships. We’re not worried about it and we can’t stress that enough.”</p><h2 id=h-pretty-empowered-say-nwa-is-heading-into-its-prettiest-era-ever>Pretty Empowered Say NWA Is Heading Into Its Prettiest Era Ever</h2><p>Pretty Empowered were then asked to describe what fans can expect from the future of NWA, now that they hold the gold.</p><p>“You can expect the prettiest era that NWA has ever been in, or will ever be in,” Paige said. “You can expect the prettiest era, and a lot of pink.”</p><p>Likewise, Envy stated that NWA is in the Pretty era, and they’re going to be sprinkling in more pink.</p><p>“Like she said, it’s the Pretty era,” Ella Envy said. “It’s time for the new girls, aka us. Get rid of Kamille and get rid of all the other losers. It’s OUR time. People wanted a change, and here it is. We’re going to be running the company on our own, and sprinkling in a little bit more pink, and a lot more pretty.</p><p>“I don’t know if you know this or not, but we have proved ourselves time after time as to why we deserve this and care about this company. Just remember that the proof is in the pretty.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>WrestleZone will have coverage of NWA Samhain as it airs on October 28.</p><p>Click <a href=#>here </a>to see what Billy Corgan had to say about NWA’s reported TV deals.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNqbXFsYGK9s7HTrbBmnZ2lvLix0Z6bZqyYnsButdJmq6GdXaW%2FpsDTsmSeqpFivKd5zbCYZq%2BVp7JutMisq6iqqWK6orfEq6o%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
