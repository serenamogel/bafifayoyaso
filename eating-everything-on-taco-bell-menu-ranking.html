I had to bring together all my individual category rankings, including my very first review — <a href=# rel data-analytics-module=body_link>Taco Bell breakfasts</a>.</p><p>My driving question was the same as always: "Which of these am I most likely to order again?" Usually, that means just judging the taste, but occasionally other factors like value played a role.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Here's the final ranking from worst to best.</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>54.

It was like someone stuffed blandness into a <a href=# rel data-analytics-module=body_link>burrito</a> that was only pretty good in the first place.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>47.

Black Bean Crunchwrap Supreme</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>A Black Bean Crunchwrap Supreme from Taco Bell. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Lucien Formichella</span></span></figure><p>Taco Bell's Crunchwraps include a soft outer shell with a crunchy hard shell alongside the fillings inside.&nbsp;</p><p>I didn't care for the beans, but overall, this was pleasant.</p><p>It still left me wondering how something with so much inside can feel so underwhelming.</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>42. Chipotle-ranch grilled-chicken burrito</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>A chipotle-ranch grilled-chicken burrito from Taco Bell. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Lucien Formichella</span></span></figure><p>This didn't feel like much of a burrito to me — it was almost what I'd imagine a <a href=# rel data-analytics-module=body_link>McDonald's</a> taco salad would taste like. I also didn't taste the avocado ranch.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>41.

This is a classic taco, after all.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>40.

It was perfectly fried and oozed delicious oil.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>39. Spicy potato taco</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>A spicy potato taco from Taco Bell. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Lucien Formichella</span></span></figure><p>The potatoes were fascinating, especially with the chipotle sauce.</p><p>I would've liked tomato or some salsa to cut the heaviness of all the carbs, but it's a great vegetarian option.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>38. Seven-layer nacho fries</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>An order of nacho fries from Taco Bell. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Lucien Formichella</span></span></figure><p>The seasoned fries served as a strong base for the beef, black beans, guacamole, nacho-cheese sauce, sour cream, creamy chipotle sauce, tomatoes, and cheddar cheese&nbsp;on this limited-time menu item.&nbsp;</p><p>The ground beef only contributed a little to the overall dish, but I didn't really mind because the rest was good.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>37. Seven-layer nacho fries – veggie</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>An order of veggie nacho fries from Taco Bell. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Lucien Formichella</span></span></figure><p>Cutting the ground beef and adding guac ended up making these nacho fries better for me. I liked the simplicity of the dish, which was also a limited-time item.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>36. Grande toasted breakfast burrito bacon</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>A breakfast burrito with bacon from Taco Bell. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Lucien Formichella</span></span></figure><p>This is probably what most people think of when they hear about a <a href=# rel data-analytics-module=body_link>Taco Bell breakfast</a>. It didn't blow my mind, but it's good — I especially enjoyed the touch of pico de gallo.</p><p>That said, the bacon was my least favorite of the breakfast meats, and I think the potatoes inside were a bit of an overkill.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>35. Grande toasted breakfast burrito steak</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>A breakfast burrito with steak from Taco Bell. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Lucien Formichella</span></span></figure><p>I'd never usually suggest going to Taco Bell for steak — you're out of luck if you like yours medium-rare — but it fits here.</p><p>The steak also cut down on the potato flavor that threatened to overtake the bacon burrito.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>34. Grande toasted breakfast burrito sausage</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>A breakfast burrito with sausage from Taco Bell. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Lucien Formichella</span></span></figure><p>Sausage is my favorite Taco Bell breakfast meat. Actually, it might be my favorite Taco Bell meat in general. It made this burrito pop, even if it couldn't completely counteract the overpowering potatoes.</p><p>Overall, I was still less wowed by the breakfast burritos than the breakfast Crunchwraps.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>33. Doritos Cheesy Gordita Crunch – Nacho Cheese</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>Doritos Cheesy Gordita Crunch – Nacho Cheese from Taco Bell. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Lucien Formichella</span></span></figure><p>I was impressed by the added ranch and consider it an above-average taco overall.</p><p>But I would rather have a regular Doritos taco — this one had too much bread with the double soft and hard shell.</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>32. Soft Taco Supreme</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>A soft-shell Taco Supreme from Taco Bell. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Lucien Formichella</span></span></figure><p>It's a solid taco, but even with the added tomato and sour cream, it was pretty plain. I don't think it's what Taco Bell does best.</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>31. Breakfast Crunchwrap bacon</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>A breakfast Crunchwrap with bacon from Taco Bell. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Lucien Formichella</span></span></figure><p>The hash brown inside made this feel like a real breakfast and added crunch.</p><p>I still don't like the bacon as much as the other meats, but I appreciate the Taco Bell spin on the classic bacon, egg, and cheese flavor combo.</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>30. Burrito Supreme</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>A Burrito Supreme from Taco Bell. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Lucien Formichella</span></span></figure><p>Again, Supreme here basically just means a few extra toppings, namely diced tomatoes and sour cream.&nbsp;</p><p>This was a solid middle-of-the-road item. The flavor combination was decent, but it lacks any bells and whistles.</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>29. Beefy-melt burrito</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>A beefy-melt burrito from Taco Bell. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Lucien Formichella</span></span></figure><p>The cheese and fiesta strips (seasoned corn chips) should've been a better combination. But the chips got lost in a crowd of cheese and beef.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>28. Fiesta-veggie burrito</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>A fiesta-veggie burrito from Taco Bell. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Lucien Formichella</span></span></figure><p>This had a pleasant citrus flavor (maybe from the guac), making the beans more palatable to me.</p><p>It's an excellent vegetarian choice, and I highly recommend it.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>27. Nachos BellGrande</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>An order of Nachos BellGrande from Taco Bell. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Lucien Formichella</span></span></figure><p>I understand why the chips are so bland now — they are not meant to be eaten alone. The salt from the beef and cheese carried the flavor, allowing the chips to serve exclusively as a vehicle for more robust flavors.</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>26. Quesarito</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>A plain Quesarito from Taco Bell. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Lucien Formichella</span></span></figure><p>I was pleasantly surprised by the spice and balance of flavors here. The ring of cheese around the center from the Quesaritta's signature quesadilla shell was also a highlight.</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>25. Black-bean Quesarito</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>A black-bean Quesarito from Taco Bell. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Lucien Formichella</span></span></figure><p>This was my favorite meatless burrito. It had an almost sweet, barbecue-like quality, which mixed well with the queso. The spice also balanced the sweetness.</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>24. Hash-brown toasted breakfast burrito bacon</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>A hash-brown burrito with bacon from Taco Bell. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Lucien Formichella for Insider</span></span></figure><p>I liked the way the hash brown rested in the middle of the burrito.</p><p>I enjoyed this one more than the other bacon breakfast options.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>23.

Unfortunately, the pizza suffered from too many ingredients — I don't think it needed both meat and beans alongside the cheese, tomatoes, and sauce.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>22. Veggie Mexican pizza</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>A veggie Mexican pizza from Taco Bell. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Lucien Formichella</span></span></figure><p>Surprisingly, I liked this pizza better. I loved the crust, which tasted like a thin Chalupa shell.</p><p>The sauce almost tasted as if all the spice was removed from a chipotle pepper, and I enjoyed it quite a bit.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>21. Chicken power bowl</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>A chicken bowl from Taco Bell. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Lucien Formichella</span></span></figure><p>The Taco Bell bowls are essentially burrito bowls filled with things like rice, black beans, cheese, sour cream, and meats.&nbsp;</p><p>Taco Bell chicken has nowhere near enough flavor for my liking. The rest was the same as the veggie bowl, which I liked more.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>20.

Basically, the best parts of a plain taco minus the meat and plus rice and guac (two underrated Taco Bell ingredients). But I think it had a little too much lettuce and tomato.&nbsp;</p><p>I still don't love the beans, but they're best in something like this. The guac was quite good, and I could see myself choosing this dish over many of the tacos.</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>19.

It's tangy and spicy, making the standard chicken and tortilla stand out.</p><p>I could see myself pairing this with a more substantial menu item.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>14.

If the chain could find a way to make this a soft-shell taco, I'd be over the moon.</p><p>The fact that a crunchy-shelled taco is ranked this high is a testament to how good Doritos are. It's the perfect "one more thing" to add to an order.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>12.

It did get a little one-note, though, and needs salsa or hot sauce.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>10. Cinnabon Delights</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>An order of Cinnabon Delights from Taco Bell. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Lucien Formichella</span></span></figure><p>Taco Bell executed the cinnamon-sugar treat perfectly here — it's just a top-tier flavor combination.&nbsp;</p><p>I also love that the icing is in the middle of the dessert.</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>9.

It made me feel like a 5-year-old, and I loved how it was unfettered by extra ingredients.</p><p>The only issue with this one is I'm not sure it's a very good value. Somehow a dollar still feels too expensive.</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>7. Hash-brown toasted breakfast burrito sausage</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>A hash-brown burrito with sausage from Taco Bell. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Lucien Formichella</span></span></figure><p>The grease and salt from the sausage mixed in with the other ingredients perfectly.</p><p>The one thing I didn't like was that the burrito didn't have enough cheese. Still, that's a minor qualm in the grand scheme of things.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>6. Chalupa Supreme</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>A Chalupa Supreme from Taco Bell. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Lucien Formichella</span></span></figure><p>I love how the Chalupa shell oozes a little oil in every bite. It's incredible how far it can take the dish because the rest is a standard Taco Bell taco.</p><p>I got the same feeling eating this as when I get a new hat — I'm the same person, but the shell makes me see things in a new light.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>5. Chicken quesadilla</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>Chicken quesadilla from Taco Bell. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Lucien Formichella</span></span></figure><p>I'm taking a few points away from the quesadilla because the chicken wasn't noticeable here, but you can't go wrong with cheese and bread.</p><p>I could also see this being a great way to sneak some protein into a little kid's diet.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>4. Cheese quesadilla</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>Cheese quesadilla from Taco Bell. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Lucien Formichella</span></span></figure><p>It's like a super version of the cheesy roll-up, and it's very close to being the best thing on the menu.</p><p>I loved the jalapeño sauce and the fact that the quesadilla includes several kinds of cheese, which rounds out the flavor. It's only knocked down because I prefer things with meat.</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>3. Double-steak grilled-cheese burrito</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>Double-steak grilled-cheese burrito&nbsp;from Taco Bell. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Lucien Formichella</span></span></figure><p>I love how Taco Bell put the cheese on top and inside of this burrito. The steak was also tough but flavorful.</p><p>This is an excellent choice, and I wish it wasn't a limited-time offering.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>2. Steak quesadilla</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>Steak quesadilla from Taco Bell. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Lucien Formichella</span></span></figure><p>I want another piece. The steak is cut fine enough that I'm not bothered by its chewy texture, and the three kinds of cheese were excellent. But the creamy jalapeño sauce really makes this.</p><p>You can switch any of the quesadillas out, depending on your preferences. In fact, I could've made a case for all three.</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>1. Spicy double-steak grilled-cheese burrito</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>Spicy double-steak grilled-cheese burrito&nbsp;from Taco Bell. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Lucien Formichella</span></span></figure><p>Once again, the creamy jalapeño sauce sets this apart from the plain double-steak burrito — and the rest of the menu.</p><p>Underneath, it's a delicious, filling burrito with two kinds of cheese, fiesta chips, and chipotle sauce. I feel like Taco Bell threw everything it had onto a tortilla and baked it in a magic oven.&nbsp;</p><p>It leans into the cheese-and-tortilla combo the chain is famous for, but with a little extra pizzazz. I wish Taco Bell would add the limited-time offering to its official menu.</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>Thank you to everyone who joined me on this wild journey — it involved more than one stomach ache.</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>It's been a journey trying everything on Taco Bell's menu. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Isabel Fernandez Pujol / Insider Photo</span></span></figure><p>After eating through the entire Taco Bell menu, my main takeaway is that my least-favorite items relied on black beans.&nbsp;</p><p>The middle of the pack is where you get a lot of value. Those items are typically cheap and are all slight variations on beans, cheese, rice, shell, and veggies.&nbsp;</p><p>I love the <a href=# rel data-analytics-module=body_link>Taco Bell specialties</a> because I fall for the gimmicks, like Doritos shells and extra cheese.
