The problem is, Tina Fey is always Tina Fey. Even when parodying the former governor of Alaska, she can’t let go of that wicked glint in her eyes. Her film debut as a math teacher in “Mean Girls” is still her most satisfying cinematic performance.</p><p>Never has this handicap been more apparent than in what is being offered as Fey’s chance to dig deep a la fellow “SNL” alum turned leading lady <a href=#>Kristen Wiig</a> and surprise us with her dramatic chops in "Whiskey Tango&nbsp;Foxtrot." The Afghanistan-set dramedy is based on an insightful, entertaining 2011 memoir injected with “<a href=#>M*A*S*H</a>”-style irreverence by <i>Chicago Tribune</i> war-zone journalist <a href=#>Kim Barker</a>. But much has been tweaked in translation. The title went from “The Taliban Shuffle” to military slang for WTF. Barker has been reborn as Kim Baker. And her occupation has been re-invented into a TV news correspondent, presumably to provide better on-the-job visuals than watching someone type.</p><p>It has been reported that the actress, who is also one of the producers, was drawn to the material after a <i>New York Times</i> book review noted that Barker portrayed herself “as a sort of Tina Fey character.” If that just isn't free license to simply play yourself, or at least your familiar persona, I don’t know what is.</p><p>Nonetheless, it is initially mildly entertaining to see this 40-ish fish-out-of-water character push herself beyond her unsatisfying comfort zone both at work and in her private life (<a href=#>Josh Charles</a>, who pops up occasionally as the boyfriend she left behind, might as well have “future cheater” tattooed on his forehead). Culture shock strikes immediately after she lands in Kabul, where she is told the air is filled with feces. There are easy laughs to be had at the outset when her head scarf slips off and a native woman sneers (with the aid of subtitles), “Cover yourself, you shameless whore.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46wn6Krm5rGbsDAp56oZZakxbW%2Bzq1ka2hhaw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
