Early December, Jarad Higgins was on a high.
The rapper, whose name will be remembered as Juice Wrld, had just finished up shows in Australia, his second time touring down under.
He stuck around a few days to celebrate his 21st birthday.
The day after he shared a photo to Instagram of him partying on a boat in Sydney Harbour, a party he planned to continue for the remainder of the week."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Several of those beats would later end up on the charts, propelled by Juice's trance inducing vocals.</p><p>He first produced for Juice Wrld on the 2017 song "Too Much Cash", but the pair would go on to collaborate prolifically in the future.</p><p>Mira produced nine songs on 2018 debut album Goodbye and Good Riddance and four songs on his 2019 follow-up Death Race for Love.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>Among those songs were breakout hits All Girls Are The Same and Lucid Dreams, which would go on to make a lot of money for The Police frontman Sting, after Mira and Juice neglected to clear a sampled melody from his 1993 song Shape of My Heart.</p><p>Mira also produced Juice Wrld's October 2019 top 10 hit Bandit, which featured rising rapper NBA Youngboy. While no one thought it at the time, Bandit would be the last song Juice Wrld released before his premature death this month.</p><p></p><p>A video for that song directed by Cole Bennett has racked up more than 87 million views.</p><p>Bennett's internet blog turned multimedia company Lyrical Lemonade has contributed significantly to the rise of many emerging artists. A Cole Bennett video is now something of a rubber stamp to take a hyped rapper seriously.</p><p>Bennett also directed the videos for singles Lucid Dreams, All Girls Are The Same and Robbery.</p><p>He would direct a total of seven music videos featuring Juice Wrld during his unfairly short career.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>Juice Wrld's early internet collaborations helped let the world know he was someone to pay attention to.</p><p>Listeners grabbed onto his mix of early 2000s emo lyricism with trap beats, as Juice shared more songs rapping and singing in an artistic blend of autotune and mumbling.</p><p>The combined effect is to turn his voice into an instrument of its own to deliver the sometimes exaggerated, but never doubted confessions.</p><p>The frequently freestyled lyrics and their often unflattering nature only added to their easy believability.</p><p>Juice Wrld's spin on the style, one previously popularised by artists like Future and Young Thug, would later lead to collaborations with the superstars, including an entire 16-song collaborative mixtape with Future in October 2018.</p><p>Wrld on Drugs was another big boost for Juice Wrld's career, letting him showcase his talents to a wider audience as he held his own alongside the more established Future on standout songs like Fine China, Red Bentley (feat.

Many argued that his violent history, which includes allegations of extreme abuse of an ex-girlfriend, should have disqualified him from the privilege of an illustrious artistic career, but his overwhelming popularity meant record labels were willing to look past all that in the race to sign him.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>Many fans first found out about X's death when blood soaked footage of his body made its way online, showing the young rapper slumped in the seat after being shot several times.</p><p>A Louis Vuitton bag containing $50,000 was allegedly the target for the two accused shooters.</p><p>A total of four men have been arrested in relation to his death.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/cOkDhlA5WpUN4zDgVsECC1fTNlA=/16x11/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/X56S6UZBCQAVYGUA6PHG4MJKM4.jpg"><p>Following XXXTentacion's death, Juice Wrld released the song Legends, a tribute to the pair that included the lyrics "What's the 27 Club?

"When I say 'we,' I mean us, as a group. The whole emo music artists.
