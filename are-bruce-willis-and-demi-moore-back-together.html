Despite their divorce, the former couple is seen spending a lot of time together. Demi recently wished Bruce a happy birthday with a photo of the two together.</p><p>“Thankful for our blended family,” she wrote in the caption.</p><p>Many people have been wondering if they are still together because of their adorable relationship.</p><h2>Are Bruce Willis And Demi Moore Reuniting</h2><p>Demi and Bruce were no longer together after their divorce in 1998. They do, however, have a very special bond. From 1987 to 2000, the couple was married and had three children together.</p><p>Rumer, Scout, and Tallulah, their three daughters, were born in 1988, 1991, and 1994, respectively. They have remained close since their divorce and are now a “blended family.” Despite the fact that they moved on with new partners and remarried, Bruce and Demi were excellent co-parents. So much so that the ex-couple and their daughters were quarantined together during the coronavirus outbreak.</p><p>Demi has consistently demonstrated her love and support for Bruce, and their special friendship is truly admirable.</p><h2>Their&nbsp; “BLENDED FAMILY”</h2><p>In 2009, Bruce married Emma Heming, with whom he has two children. When Demi and Ashton Kutcher were married, Emma said they had a “comfortable and fun” relationship. Bruce even described them as a “tribe.”</p><p>Their relationship piqued people’s interest because not all ex-lovers get along like Demi and Bruce. “It’s generated a lot of interest because everyone can understand resentment and envy in the breakup of a marriage, but they don’t understand how I can get along with my ex like that,” Bruce said.</p><p>“Demi and I made the decision to prioritize the kids, and we’re really lucky that it turns out we all have fun together,” he said.</p><h2>Bruce’s Medical Condition Has Saddened The Fans</h2><p>The news of Bruce’s medical condition has saddened his fans. They rushed to Twitter to send him their best wishes.</p><p>“How very sad,” one person tweeted. Bruce Willis has kept us entertained for decades. We wish him the best of luck.”</p><p>“Wow!!! It’s not Bruce Willis. I adore him and his talent. “I hope his health improves and he is able to work again of his own volition,” wrote another.</p><p>“So, sad love Bruce Willis,” another fan wrote. I hope he and his family are doing well despite everything. Hugs to everyone. You’ll be sorely missed on the big screen.”</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiYq51dl7%2B2r8RmrqKknJ7Abq3NnWSdnZ2eeq67zqucZpqRmLhuwM6gnK2glad8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
