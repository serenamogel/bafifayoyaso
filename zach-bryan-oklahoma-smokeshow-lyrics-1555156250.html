The song portrays the challenges and struggles she faces as she navigates her life in this small town and deals with the expectations imposed on her.</p><p>The first verse sets the scene where the girl dresses up and goes out, possibly seeking some excitement or escape from her mundane life. It suggests that she might have an absent or neglectful father, which might influence her choices.</p><p>The chorus repeats the phrase "Oklahoma Smokeshow" and mentions the guy as an "asshole," implying that their relationship might not be healthy or respectful. The lines "She'll never make it out alive / That small town bar scene / Where small vices kill your big dreams" highlight the stifling nature of living in a small town where opportunities may be limited, and bad habits or vices can hinder personal growth.</p><p>The bridge mentions the narrator's perspective, expressing their thoughts about being up all night and contemplating a life with the girl. It suggests that there might be unspoken feelings or desires between the narrator and the girl, but they believe she won't have the chance to explore these possibilities due to her circumstances.</p><p>Overall, the lyrics tell a tale of a young woman stuck in a small town with limited prospects, possibly in a toxic relationship, and yearning for something more, but it seems like her situation prevents her from pursuing her dreams fully.
