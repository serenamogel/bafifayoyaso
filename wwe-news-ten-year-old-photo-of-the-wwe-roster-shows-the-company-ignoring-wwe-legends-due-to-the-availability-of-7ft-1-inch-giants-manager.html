The 7 ft 1-inch giant wrestler weighed in at over 400 lbs during his WWE tenure and stood over the likes of some biggest stars, including Undertaker, Big Show, and many more. WWE helped him to cope with the language barrier by providing him with two managers, Shawn Daivari and former WWE writer Ranjin Singh.</p><p>Ranjin Singh was also Khali‚Äôs kayfabe brother, who used to do the promos for him. He wasn‚Äôt a wrestler or usual wrestling manager, rather WWE appointed him as he was Indian and was able to work as Khali‚Äôs mouthpiece. He accompanied<a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9> the former WWE Hall of Famer </a>throughout his reign as the World Heavyweight champion.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><strong>Brian Gewirtz points out WWE snubbing big talents for Ranjin Singh</strong></h2><p>However, Dave Kapoor aka Ranjin Singh wasn‚Äôt seen in any WWE match after his storyline with Khali ended. That being said, many big talents of the company were sidelined to an extent because of his availability on the roster as he was ranked surprisingly high on the roster internally.</p><p>Recently, former WWE writer Brian Gewirtz took a cheeky dig at him for taking the spots of legendary stars like <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Triple H</a>, Undertaker, and Brock Lesnar back in 2013. Gewirtz referred to an old WWE roster photo to prove his point.</p><a href=# class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b transparent-card"><img id="img-tag-wwe-news-kill-the-undertaker-the-great-khali-reveals-vince-mcmahons-instructions-on-his-smackdown-debut?utm_campaign=internal_links&utm_medium=dive_deeper&utm_source=website-embed-image" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-485063226-473x315.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b card-content">‚ÄúKill The Undertaker‚Äù ‚Äì The Great Khali Reveals Vince McMahon‚Äôs Instructions on His Smackdown Debut</p></a><p>The writer wrote on Twitter, ‚ÄùTo prove my point: A talent roster from 2013.

Khali joined India‚Äôs ruling political party Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in February 2022. The former heavyweight champion replaced his rowdy look with a formal blazer, a neat ponytail perfectly fit in his slicked-back hair.</p><p>Khali reasoned his debut in politics, saying, ‚ÄùI have always loved my country. I was also impressed by all the work done by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.‚Äù</p><img id=img-tag-node--img-loader-0 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/20210128235852/The_Great_Khali_bio.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>The former World Heavyweight Champion also ruled out money and fame as his motive behind jumping into politics. The 50-year-old added, ‚Äò‚ÄòI have wrestled all over the world. If I just loved money and fame, then I would have stayed in the United States and in the WWE.‚Äù</p><p>Speaking of Ranjin Singh, he has been completely away from the public eye as of late.</p><p><strong>Watch This Story: <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>GSP Offered By WWE</a></strong></p><p>What are your thoughts on Brian Gewirtz‚Äôs recent Twitter post about WWE‚Äôs roster listing from nearly a decade ago?
