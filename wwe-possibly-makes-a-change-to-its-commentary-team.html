The latest debut that has fans buzzing occurred earlier this week, and it may hint at a shift in the commentary landscape.</p><p>Since the last WWE commentary shuffle, which saw Wade Barrett and Michael Cole make their move from SmackDown to Raw, Wade Barrett has been the familiar voice calling the action on WWE Main Event alongside Byron Saxton. Main Event, for those in the know, is taped every Monday night before Raw takes center stage.</p><p>However, this week brought an unexpected twist to the commentary booth. Wade Barrett’s usual partner, Byron Saxton, found himself sharing the mic with a fresh face – none other than Blake Howard.</p><p>Blake Howard, who has been the lead commentator for NXT Level Up since February, teamed up with Byron Saxton for his Main Event debut. Clearly excited about this career milestone, <a href=#>Howard took to Instagram</a> to share his thoughts, calling it “the greatest night of my career thus far.”</p><p>“Simply put, the greatest night of my career thus far. Check out Main Event, airing this Thursday on Hulu, as I call the action with the Wade Barrett. Thank you Greenville for a night I will absolutely NEVER forget!!! @wwe #mainevent #wwe #nxt”</p><p>While it’s unclear at this point if this is a permanent move, the WWE Universe will undoubtedly be keeping a close watch on the commentary team dynamics. Change is in the air, and fans are eager to see what the future holds for WWE commentary.</p><p>The matches featured on this week’s Main Event included Kayden Carter vs. Blair Davenport and Akira Tozawa vs. Wes Lee. It’s worth noting that WWE has been giving NXT talents opportunities to showcase their skills on Main Event, so this commentary adjustment might not necessarily indicate an immediate main roster call-up for anyone involved.</p><p>As the world of WWE commentary continues to evolve, one thing remains certain – the excitement and unpredictability of the wrestling universe are here to stay!</p><figure class=wp-block-embed></figure><p>What are your thoughts on Blake Howard joining the WWE Main Event commentary team alongside Byron Saxton?
