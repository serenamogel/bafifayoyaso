It consists of a grid of squares, both black and white, arranged in a rectangular or square shape. The goal of the crossword puzzle is to fill in the white squares with letters to form words based on the given clues.</p><p>The puzzle is typically divided into two main sections: across and down. Clues are provided for each word in the grid, indicating the definition, synonym, or a hint related to the word. The number of letters in each word is usually indicated in parentheses after the clue. The words intersect with each other, sharing common letters, which helps to solve the puzzle as the solver fills in the grid.</p><p>Crossword puzzles often incorporate themes or have a specific topic that ties the clues and answers together. For example, a crossword puzzle might have a theme related to a specific holiday, a particular field of knowledge, or a famous person.</p><p>Solving a crossword puzzle requires a combination of knowledge, vocabulary, logic, and wordplay skills. It challenges the solver's ability to think critically, make connections, and apply their understanding of words and their meanings. It can be an entertaining and intellectually stimulating activity that helps improve vocabulary, memory, and problem-solving skills.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 class=faq_title>Munitions compounds NYT Crossword Clue - FAQs</h2><p>1.
