Not only will proper aftercare protect your tattoo from infection, but the right long-term care will ensure it stays looking its best. The thing is, while tattoos theoretically last forever, they can fade over time. So to help you out in your fight against tattoo damage, we tapped two experts to get their best advice and pro tips on the dos and don'ts of caring for your tattoo.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keep reading for how to protect your tattoo and make it last longer, according to tattoo artists.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-tattoo-aftercare></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Tattoo Aftercare</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The first few days after getting a tattoo are very important as the treated area will essentially be an open wound, so you need to protect it from irritation and infection. As such, keep the area clean and protected from external factors, such as water, irritating skincare products, or physical friction.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"After the bandage is taken off, let the tattoo breathe for a day or two," says Los Angeles-based celebrity tattoo artist and founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>WOO Skin Essentials</a>, Dr. Woo. "Keep it out of direct sunlight, only wash it with fragrance-free cleansers, and after 24 to 36 hours, apply a light coating of the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>WOO After/Care Moisturizer</a> once or twice a day."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Also, your tattoo will likely peel or flake â€” but don't pick at it. Apart from the potential risk of infection, this could cause scarring and lead to your tattoo being altered. Instead, let your skin do its thing and nurture it with moisturizer and sunscreen throughout the process.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-tips-for-long-term-tattoo-care></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Tips for Long-Term Tattoo Care</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Wear sunscreen daily.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"For long-term tattoo care, keep your tattoo moisturized, avoid direct sunlight while healing, exfoliate, and use sunscreen to preserve color," says KVD Beauty's global director of tattoo artistry, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Miryam Lumpini</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So, say it with us: Sunscreen is your best friend. Hopefully, you're already wearing sunscreen every day to prevent skin cancer and visible signs of aging, but it's also important to use SPF on your tattoos to prevent them from fading.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Simplify your skincare routine.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While you should think of tattoo care as your regular skin care, Dr. Woo says to avoid going overboard with skincare products. "Less is more," he says, adding that moisturizing is his biggest tip for keeping tattooed skin healthy.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Practice healthy habits.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For a more holistic approach, Lumpini says to keep your skin healthy from the inside out. "[This] can be influenced by diet, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>stress levels</a>, and overall mental and physical health," she adds.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: Couples Tattoo Ideas For When You're Really Ready to Commit</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-tattoo-placement-affects-its-longevity></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Tattoo Placement Affects Its Longevity</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Both experts confirm that the location of your tattoo will likely affect how it's going to age. "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Hands</a>, feet, and inside the mouth are probably the worst places to get a tattoo because of skin's texture and its constant exposure to water and products," Lumpini says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Woo also says that areas that crease often, like the elbows and knees, are prone to fading. And, while he acknowledges that hand and foot tattoos are popular, he tells his customers that maintaining tattoos in those areas is tricky.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you want your tattoo to have a better chance of looking fresh in the long run, consider getting one in a spot that can hold ink better. For example, Lumpini suggests the chest, arms, legs, and stomach as better options for long-term brightness.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-other-factors-that-can-affect-a-tattoos-longevity></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Other Factors That Can Affect a Tattoo's Longevity</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Color, lines, and shading can all affect how long a tattoo will look sharp," Lumpini says. However, she adds that it largely depends on the techniques the artist uses, the quality of ink, and tattoo supplies."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Any professional tattooist should be able to handle the best execution of a tattoo," Dr. Woo says. That said, we cannot stress enough how important it is to do your research and find a tattoo artist who knows their way around a tattoo gun and who you feel comfortable with.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-bottom-line></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Bottom Line</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you have any concerns about how a tattoo will look after a few years, talk it over with your artist. Depending on your desired outcome, you may decide to make a design a little bigger so the lines are more clear or either add or remove shading. Artists recommend consultations before diving into tattoos so you can discuss all this, so make sure to get all your questions answered.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZMCstc1on6ivXam8brnApJxmrJGpwbC70majmqukYrmwusY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
